### HHVM build status report

[HHVM] is a virtual machine and just-in-time compiler (JIT) for
applications written in PHP and Hack. It was developed by Facebook,
and a few months ago (W21) I reported on the successful effort to
port HHVM to ARM.

Since then, I've had a chance to try this out first hand, relying
on the HHVM Github repository and the hhvm-arm mailing list for help.
If you want to make your own way through this journey, here's some
notes that will save you some time.

1. The test suite is written in PHP, and PHP 7 will run the tests
just fine once you bring in an internationalization library.
`sudo apt-get install php7.0-intl`. If you don't have the intl
library installed, you'll get an error related to
[Uncaught Error: Class 'UConverter' not found](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/7928).

2. The tests expect to run as an unprivileged user, and not as root.

3. The ext_posix.php test assumes that there is a 'wheel'  group.  Try
`sudo groupadd wheel`. 

4. Apply patch 7912, [AArch64 Fix getFrameRegs assertion during indirect fixup](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/pull/7912) before compiling. 
If you don't you'll get errors in the two tests hphp/test/quick/setg-dtor.php
and hphp/test/quick/sets-dtor.php and perhaps also in ir_inlining/1.php.

5. After all of this is done, I was able to get a system that passed 
all of the "quick" tests, and failed only one of the "slow" tests. Look
for `uspoof.php`, and review these two issues:

* [test/slow/ext_icu/uspoof.php consistently fails](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/3925), 3925
* [Refactor test/slow/ext_icu/uspoof.php to split apart the icu_49 components](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/7939), 7939

The reason for the test failure appears to be something deep in Facebook's
decision about which Unicode internationalization library to use, a library
(ICU 49) that has slightly different semantics from the current version
(ICU 55) affecting just one test.

Thanks to Steve Walk and Jim Saxman for their help to date!

### Work in progress: LinuxKit for multiple architectures

If you're tracking the progress of building LinuxKit on multiple
architectures, the following open issues on Github are of interest:

* LinuxKit: https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/issues/2292 "Multiarch support for packages"
* LinuxKit: https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/pull/2350 "Grand conversion to multi-arch manifests" 
* LinuxKit: https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/issues/1377 "[tracking] ARM boot status"
* Docker CLI: https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/138 "Add manifest command"
* Docker CLI: https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/392 "Docker Content Trust for docker manifest Command"

In 2292, Rolf Neugebauer writes:

> We now have both x86_64 and arm64 linuxkit/alpine images as well
as initial support for building arm64 kernels. So we are getting
close to full arm64 support.

> We want this support to be transparent, ie ideally we can use the
same YAML file without any changes to build x86_64 and arm64 LinuxKit
images (and other archs in the future). The best way to achieve
this is using multiarch images/manifests, currently using the
manifest-tool. The tool pushes a manifest to hub which contains
references to to the different images (e.g. for different architectures).
I suggest we add the manifest-tool the the top-level Makefile in
linuxkit.

### Work in progress: .NET CoreCLR and CoreFX

Work is well underway on porting .NET CoreCLR and CoreFX to ARM64,
to the point where these builds are being added to the CI system.
If you are tracking this, the relevant issues are

* [Add linux-arm64 to official builds](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/13212), CoreCLR 13212
* [Arm64/Unix Add OfficialBuildRID linux-arm64](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/21236), CoreFX 21236
* [Add linux-arm64 to official builds](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues/2969), Core Setup 2969

These changes are all targetted at the .NET Core 2.1 release, 
currently scheduled for approximately September 15, 2017.

### Azul Systems and Qualcomm Bring Enterprise-Grade Open Source Java on ARM to Datacenters

Full press release at https://www.azul.com/press_release/azul-systems-qualcomm-bring-open-source-java-centriq-arm/

SUNNYVALE, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Azul Systems, Inc., in collaboration
with Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm
Incorporated, today announced the general availability of new
versions of Zulu Enterprise and Zulu Embedded, a complete open
source development and runtime platform for server-side Java
applications, for the Qualcomm Centriq™ 2400 Server Processor. The
new version of Zulu supports Java 8 and the ARM®v8-A architecture.

Engineers and developers who design or maintain Java-based systems
can now harness the high core count, high performance and power
efficiency of the Qualcomm Centriq 2400 processor to drive architectural
innovation in the datacenter.

Zulu and Zulu Embedded are certified and tested open source builds
of OpenJDK. The Zulu build of OpenJDK running on the Qualcomm Centriq
2400 processor includes a high-performance JIT compiler and delivers
highly optimized machine code at runtime for server-based Java
applications.

Pricing and Availability

All Azul Systems Zulu and Zulu Embedded builds of OpenJDK are 100%
open source and free to download and use without restrictions. Azul
offers flexible and cost-effective support contracts including
timely security updates and IP protection for both standard and
custom builds of Zulu, helping DevOps and product development teams
reduce their Java support costs by up to 50% or more. Visit
http://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/zulu-download-arm/ to learn more
and to download Zulu for the Qualcomm Centriq 2400 Server Processor.
Builds of Zulu for 32-bit ARM-based processors, as well as 32/64-bit
Intel x86 processors, are available at http://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-embedded.
