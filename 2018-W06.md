### Ampere Computing announcement

> Santa Clara, CA. (February 5, 2018) – Today a new company, Ampere™, was launched to address memory performance, cost, space and power constraints for emerging hyperscale cloud applications and next-generation data centers. Ampere was born in and built for private and public clouds and delivers customers reliable 64-bit Arm® server processors with high memory performance and substantially lower power and total cost of ownership (TCO). The company is backed by The Carlyle Group.

> Ampere processors offer a modern architecture with a unique, high performance, custom core Armv8-A 64-bit server operating at up to 3.3 GHz, 1TB of memory at a power envelope of 125 watts. The processors are sampling now and will be in production in the second half of the year.

> The leadership team is comprised of semiconductor and cloud computing experts, including several well-known architects from the industry. Renee James, former president of Intel, is the CEO.

### Ampere: analysis

David Schor, WikiChip, via Twitter: "This chip is largely the
'Skylark' uarch."

Kevin Krewell, TIRIAS, via Data Center Knowledge: "They have a solid
product. Over 3 GHz is a good clock speed and 125 watts is very
efficient. It’s got good price, performance and power. With the new
design team and the new management team, they have a reasonable
chance."

STH: "We expect approximately a $1k price for these chips. 
Although X-Gene 3 was at OCP Summit 2017, Ampere expects 
mid-2018 shipments. That is going to put them in contention with 
shipping ARM server products and a next-generation of x86 solutions."
