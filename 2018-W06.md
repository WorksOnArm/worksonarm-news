### Ampere Computing announcement

> Santa Clara, CA. (February 5, 2018) – Today a new company, Ampere™, was launched to address memory performance, cost, space and power constraints for emerging hyperscale cloud applications and next-generation data centers. Ampere was born in and built for private and public clouds and delivers customers reliable 64-bit Arm® server processors with high memory performance and substantially lower power and total cost of ownership (TCO). The company is backed by The Carlyle Group.

> Ampere processors offer a modern architecture with a unique, high performance, custom core Armv8-A 64-bit server operating at up to 3.3 GHz, 1TB of memory at a power envelope of 125 watts. The processors are sampling now and will be in production in the second half of the year.

> The leadership team is comprised of semiconductor and cloud computing experts, including several well-known architects from the industry. Renee James, former president of Intel, is the CEO.

### Ampere: analysis

David Schor, WikiChip, via Twitter: "This chip is largely the
'Skylark' uarch."

Kevin Krewell, TIRIAS, via Data Center Knowledge: "They have a solid
product. Over 3 GHz is a good clock speed and 125 watts is very
efficient. It’s got good price, performance and power. With the new
design team and the new management team, they have a reasonable
chance."

STH: "We expect approximately a $1k price for these chips. 
Although X-Gene 3 was at OCP Summit 2017, Ampere expects 
mid-2018 shipments. That is going to put them in contention with 
shipping ARM server products and a next-generation of x86 solutions."

### Hardkernel ODroid N1 (via CNXSoft - Embedded Systems News)

The ODroid N1 is a Rockchip RK3399 arm64 board under development.
If all goes according to plan, it will ship with 4G of memory and
a dual SATA configuration. Debian Stretch is the first target
operating system, as Ubuntu 18.04 "Bionic Beaver" is not ready
yet. We saw the announcement via @CNXsoft - Embedded Systems News
which always has good details of new single-board computer systems.

### Booting the LeMaker Cello arm64 development board

The LeMaker Cello is a 96boards Enterprise Edition Single Board Computer 
based on the AMD "Seattle" Opteron A1100 ARM Processor. 
A short run of these boards was produced before they
were discontinued. In "Bring up of the LeMaker Cello",
Carl Perry (edolnx) carefully documents the several steps
necessary to get these systems online. He writes

> Thanks a bunch to Ard, Robert, and Ricardo from 96boards for their help getting my Cello boards up and running!

## Software

### Puppet Enterprise adds support for arm64

Puppet Enterprise is an IT automation solution that allows you to automate the provisioning, configuring, and managing of servers that is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 on arm64.

> We're very excited to add support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 agents running on Arm's AArch64 CPU architecture. We've developed this capability in partnership with Arm to better serve Puppet Enterprise customers who are deploying Arm-based servers in their data centers.
