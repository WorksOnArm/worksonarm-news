### Ampere Computing announcement

### Ampere: analysis

David Schor, WikiChip, via Twitter: "This chip is largely the
'Skylark' uarch."

Kevin Krewell, TIRIAS, via Data Center Knowledge: "They have a solid
product. Over 3 GHz is a good clock speed and 125 watts is very
efficient. Itâ€™s got good price, performance and power. With the new
design team and the new management team, they have a reasonable
chance."
