### Amazon EC2 Bare Metal Instances with Direct Access to Hardware (Jeff Barr, Amazon)

Amazon has announced at their 2017 Las Vegas re:Invent conference
that they would be supporting a "bare metal" option for servers.
These are Intel based systems with custom hardware, but  "We don't build snowflakes".

Jacob Smith from Packet writes (in a blog written a few days before
the announcement) about his take on the real reason for the 

> Rumors about Amazon’s bare metal product started percolating last
year after the announcement of VMware Cloud on AWS.  And while the
target market for an AWS bare metal product could be established
software ecosystems like VMware that need a “cloud home”, I really
think this all makes sense because of Kubernetes.

> Kubernetes, and its related cloud native brothers and sisters,
represent the Achilles-heel of Cloud 1.0.  The vertical “lock you
in” model works well when that workload is difficult or impossible
to move around, and when the software (like the RDS database service)
is superior to open source alternatives.  But the promise - and
fast emerging reality - of the cloud native ecosystem is that it’s
not hard to move, and that open source is moving faster than even
Amazon can.  It’s built to be hyper-portable from the get go, and
has the benefit of the crowd (just ask Quantopian about the power
of crowd-sourcing incredibly hard things).

### Is parallel programming hard? (Paul E. McKenney via Jon Masters, Red Hat)

Jon Masters writes on Twitter: "This is some of the best holiday
reading around." He is referring to Paul E. McKenney's new release
of "Is Parallel Programming Hard, And, If So, What Can You Do About
It?" aka `perfbook`. It's a 500+ page college-level academic textbook
about parallel programming and how to wring the best understanding
out of multicore and manycore systems.

Pierre Kuo, SeongJae Park, and Yubin Ruan; a new futures section
on quantum computing; updates to the formal-verification section
based on recent collaborations; and a full rewrite of the memory-barriers
section, which is now its own chapter. This rewrite was of course
based on recent work with my partners in memory-ordering crime,
Jade Alglave, Luc Maranget, Andrea Parri, and Alan Stern.

### OpenFaaS Ltd and Patreon campaign (Alex Ellis, OpenFaaS Ltd)

Alex Ellis has launched OpenFaaS Ltd to support this "Functions
as a Service" platform. A Patreon campaign encourages individual
donations to support hosting and other infrastructure needs.

### Armbian 5.35 (CNXSoft via Mininodes)

Armbian is an operating system for Arm-based single-board computers.
Version 5.35 is based on the 4.13.y Linux kernel and v2017.09 of u-boot.
"Major update on all stable builds. It’s time for apt update & upgrade to v5.35"

### Pillow port to Arm 

The Pillow project ("Python Imaging Library") is working on
a port to Arm. Eric Soroos and Alex Clark are project leads.

> The Pillow Project is the maintained fork of the Python Imaging
Library, an open source library for image manipulation in python.

Resources for the effort will be provided by the Works on Arm project.

### Fedora 27 (Peter Robinson, Red Hat / Fedora)

> Support for ARM 64 bit (aarch64) Single Board Computers (SBCs)
has been one of the most highly requested features along side the
Raspberry Pi. It’s something I’ve been working towards almost as
long too. Finally with Fedora 27 I felt we would have enough of the
bits in place for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## Industry news

### "Cavium Is Truly A Contender With One-Two Arm Server Punch" (Timothy Prickett Morgan, The Next Platform)

The Next Platform has a positive story on Cavium's
development of their ThunderX2 processors.

> It has been two years since chip maker Cavium rolled out its
ThunderX Arm server processor roadmap and gave us the first glimpse
of its second-generation ThunderX2 processors. A lot has changed
in that time, and Cavium is now sitting in the cat-bird seat of the
Arm server market at just the moment that it is merging with rival
chipmaker Marvell.
