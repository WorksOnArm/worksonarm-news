### Gigabyte announces Cavium ThunderX2 support

TAIPEI, Taiwan, May 29 2017 – GIGABYTE Technology, a leading producer
of high performance server hardware, and Cavium, Inc. (NASDAQ:
CAVM), a leading provider of semiconductor products that enable
intelligent processing for enterprise, data center, cloud, wired
and wireless networking - today announced availability of high
performance ARM server platforms based on Cavium's second generation
64-bit ARMv8 ThunderX2 product family.

More details can be found in the [GIGABYTE press release], which
quotes [Rishi Chugh], Director Product Marketing for Cavium's Data
Center Processor Group and Etay Lee, General Manager of GIGABYTE.

### Alpine Linux 3.6.0, 3.6.1

Alpine Linux announced a new release, [Alpine Linux 3.6.0], the
first in the 3.6 stable series. This release continues ARM support,
and adds support for IBM z and Power processors.

There has been a significant refresh for a number of development
packages, including Rust 1.17.0, Cargo 0.18.0, PHP 7.1, LLVM 4.0,
Go 1.8, Python 3.6, nginx 1.12 and Ruby 2.4. The kernel provided
is the LTS Linux 4.9.29 kernel.

This release was followed on June 1, 2017 with a bug fix release,
[Alpine Linux 3.6.1], which contains bug fixes including security
updates for libtasn1, samba, libxcmcp, strongswan,
openldap, and mosquitto. Kernel support is now 4.9.30.

### New Docker container directory for "arm64v8"

Alpine is a frequent choice for Docker projects because of its
compact packaging which results in remarkably small Docker
images. 
As of this writing, the new Alpine release has not yet been
picked up by Docker for their popular [aarch64/alpine container].
This is because Docker reorganized their container support on 
DockerHub to use new names, making the it now [arm64v8/alpine].

[aarch64/alpine container]:https://hub.docker.com/r/aarch64/alpine/
[arm64v8/alpine]:https://hub.docker.com/r/arm64v8/alpine/

The new naming scheme is unique to Docker, and allows them
to distinguish between the various 32-bit ARM variants that
have distinctly different container support, e.g.
'arm32v6' for the original Raspberry Pi and the Pi Zero.

### OpenSUSE on ARM hardware

[Andreas Färber] has an hour-long [presentation on OpenSUSE on ARM hardware],
in which he details the state of OpenSUSE on a whole
series of ARM development boards. The talk was presented at
the openSUSE Conference 2017 and published on May 27, 2017.
Andreas notes that this is "not a hardware selection guide",
and recommends that if you want ARM hardware recommendations
that you consult the [opensuse-arm mailing list] instead.

Andreas's hard work and others have resulted in OpenSUSE for
a number of systems, with more in progress, tracked on their
development wiki. Among those systems where OpenSUSE has some
good results include the 
[DragonBoard 410c],
[Firefly-RK3399] (in progress),
[Odroid C2],
[Pine64],
and [Raspberry Pi 3].

[Pine64]:https://en.opensuse.org/HCL:Pine64
[Raspberry Pi 3]:https://en.opensuse.org/HCL:Raspberry_Pi3

OpenSUSE also supports a [standard UEFI boot process], and
the provided instructions would enable you to PXE boot the
system.

### Ard Biesheuvel's "Works of ARD" weblog and "Project dogfood".

[Ard Biesheuvel] is a developer for Linaro, working on the ARM
open source ecosystem. He writes in March 2017 about
[Project dogfood: my arm64 desktop], an effort to bring a full
64-bit ARM environment to the desktop using an 
AMD Overdrive B1 development board in an ATX form factor.

Ard writes:

Among the things he had to sort out to make this possible included
getting a quieter fan, identifying a good case and power supply,
USB and graphics support, and a number of kernel and firmware issues.

The most challenging issue identified, and the one with the most
creative solution, involved finding firmware support for boards
whose drivers are written only in x86 code. The workaround
reads as follows:

> So when Alexander Graf (of Suse) approached me at Linaro Connect
two weeks ago, to discuss the possibilities of running x86 option
ROMs on an emulator inside UEFI, I was skeptical at first, but after
some more thought and discussion, I decided it was worth a try.
Over the past ten days, we have collaborated online, and managed
to implement an X86 emulator inside UEFI, based on an old version
of QEMU (which is still LGPL licensed) combined with the more recent
AArch64 support (whose copyright is owned by HiSilicon)

The successful result is documented in a video, [gui boot on overdrive b1].

### pigz, a fast parallel version of gzip 

[pigz] is a "parallel implementation of gzip for modern
multi-processor, multi-core machines". By breaking your
compression problem into pieces and then doing each piece
individually, pigz effectively uses as much of your machine
as you will let it to compress data quickly.

[pigz]:http://www.zlib.net/pigz/

A sample will illustrate. On a 123 megabyte file (the source code
for PostgreSQL), standard gzip took 18.4 seconds to compress
a tar file on the 96-core Type 2A ARMv8 machine at Packet. With
pigz, the same operation took 0.4 seconds, a 45x speedup on a 96-core
machine.

pigz - pronounced "pig-zee" - is credited to Mark Adler, and is 
is available as a part of the Ubuntu and CentOS distributions.
You can also compile it from its provided source code.

96-core Cavium based ARM server on Packet.
