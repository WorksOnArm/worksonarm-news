## Industry news

### Apple considering move away from legacy processors

Bloomberg reported on Monday, April 2, 2018 that Apple is
said to plan to move from Intel processors to their own
chips for Macintosh designs by 2020. The report led
to a flurry of speculation about what future Arm-powered
Macs might look like, how Apple would handle the transition
to a new architecture, and the future of macOS versus iOS.

The news coverage generates more questions than answers.
Apple does use an Arm-powered processor to drive the
"touch bar" on MacBook Pro keyboards, and their in-house
designed chips were the subject of an earlier Bloomberg
story describing the evolution of Apple as a chip powerhouse.

## Operating systems

### Ubuntu 18.04 Beta

The Ubuntu 18.04 LTS release date is set for April 26, 2018.  This
release uses the Linux 4.15 kernel, which includes patches for the
Meltdown and Spectre security flaws.

The Beta 2 releases, dated April 6, 2018, include arm64 ISO
images as well as image files preinstalled for Raspberry Pi 2
armhf systems.

### Fedora 28 Beta

Fedora 28 beta has been announced. This release will have first-class
support for arm64, supporing Fedora Server initially for a variety of
systems including SBSA-standard arm64 servers.

### OpenBSD/arm64 6.3 for Pine64, Raspberry Pi 3

OpenBSD 6.3 ships with improved support for arm64 on the Pine64
and Raspberry Pi 3 systems, including SMP support on these
platforms and drivers for a bunch of hardware components.

### Oracle Linux 7.4

Oracle Linux 7.4 targets the Raspberry Pi 3, Cavium ThunderX,
and Ampere processors. It's based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
but with Oracle's branding replacing Red Hat, and with the
"Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel" replacing the Red Hat kernel.

Oracle Linux 7 for ARM64 will be  a 64-bit only distribution (aarch64),
with no user or kernel dependencies on 32-bit code.

### Alpine Linux building on Works on Arm cluster

Thanks to a contribution from the Works on Arm project,
Alpine Linux is building arm64 binaries on a Cavium
ThunderX 96-core Packet Type 2A system. Natanael Copa
posts a screen capture showing all 96 cores in use
during a compile.

## Languages

### BellSoft Liberica 10 - TCK verified OpenJDK 10 binary

Bellsoft has announced Liberica 10, an OpenJDK 10 binary for
the Raspberry Pi (armv7) platform. The code is TCK verified.
Plans and work are underway for an arm64 distribution of
the code as well.

### Optimizing Go for High Performance with ARM64 Assembly (Linaro Connect SFO17)

A presentation from Linaro Connect SFO17 has been
making the rounds again regarding optimizing Go for
arm64 assembly. The account of how 64-bit Arm systems
can have algorithms sped up considerably for Go has
was prelude to the current round of performance optimizations
that are scheduled to be released in Go 1.11.

## Containers and Kubernetes

### OpenEBS for Kubernetes on arm64

OpenEBS provides a persistent storage layer for containers
running on Kubernetes. Murat Karslioglu has a tutorial on 
setting up OpenEBS on the AML-S905X-CC "Le Potato" single-board
computer, which has 2GB of memory and a processor that's
50% faster than a Raspberry Pi Model 3.

The build uses Armbian 5.38 Ubuntu Xenial for the Le Potatos,
installing Docker and Kubernetes and then building OpenEBS on
arm64 from source.

The article is the first in a series from Murat and we're
looking forward to hearing more about how these builds go.

## Big Data

### Apache Bigtop (Linaro Connect HKG18)

At the Linaro Connect conference in Hong Kong, a presentation
on Apache Bigtop discusses some of the challenges facing this
big data project that produces artifacts needed for the Hadoop
ecosystem.

## Hardware

### Ampere eMAG at OCP

Ampere showed off their eMAG processor at the OCP Summit, and Serve
the Home stopped by their booth to take a look and do a review. They
report:

> Both Ampere and Qualcomm Centriq are essentially targeting a
segment of the market for high performance single socket that Intel
does not have a great solution for but it looks like the first
generation products are going to be mostly used as lab demos rather
than for broad deployments.

### MACCHIATObin Double Shot

The MACCHIATObin Double Shot is a quad-core Marvell Armada 8040
based system with 16GB of memory. This evaluation board sells for
$499 and is one of the few arm64-based single-board computers to
hit the 16GB memory mark.
