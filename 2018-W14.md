## Industry news

### Apple considering move away from legacy processors

Bloomberg reported on Monday, April 2, 2018 that Apple is
said to plan to move from Intel processors to their own
chips for Macintosh designs by 2020. The report led
to a flurry of speculation about what future Arm-powered
Macs might look like, how Apple would handle the transition
to a new architecture, and the future of macOS versus iOS.

The news coverage generates more questions than answers.
Apple does use an Arm-powered processor to drive the
"touch bar" on MacBook Pro keyboards, and their in-house
designed chips were the subject of an earlier Bloomberg
story describing the evolution of Apple as a chip powerhouse.

### Optimizing Go for High Performance with ARM64 Assembly (Linaro Connect SFO17)

A presentation from Linaro Connect SFO17 has been
making the rounds again regarding optimizing Go for
arm64 assembly. The account of how 64-bit Arm systems
can have algorithms sped up considerably for Go has
was prelude to the current round of performance optimizations
that are scheduled to be released in Go 1.11.
