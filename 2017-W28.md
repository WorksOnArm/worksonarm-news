### Fedora 26 on ARM release

Fedora 26 is here, after completing its beta period. Fedora is the
upstream release for Red Hat Linux. Notable in this release from
a server perspective is a move to Go 1.8, gcc 7, and Python 3.6.

Fedora on ARM appears in two distinct packagings. 64-bit ARMv8
versions are in the "alt architectures" bin, and 32-bit ARMv7
releases are in the "Fedora for ARM" category. There are also
cloud-bootable and Docker images available.

* https://arm.fedoraproject.org/ - 32 bit ARM armv7

### Dennis Chen continued work on Linuxkit on ARM

Work continues on porting Linuxkit, Docker's new operating 
system construction kit, to ARM. Recent progress has been
helped by Dennis Chen of ARM who has spent some time and
effort to make progress on core technical issues as well
as packaging issues.

### FreeIPA on Centos 7 on ARM

Maxim Burgerhout writes up his experiences running FreeIPA, an
identity and access control system used to manage Red Hat
networks, on CentOS 7 on his Raspberry Pi 3. The notes are
detailed and extensive and may be useful to others who are
porting RPMs to that enviornment. He writes:

> My RPi3 runs CentOS7 for aarch64, based on the image that is
available for download here. All in all, it works pretty well, with
some caveats. One of those caveats is that the standard mock RPM
doesn’t provide a configuration file for aarch64.

### "Rock64" debut from Pine64 

In single-board computer news, the "Rock64" is a new system from
the makers of the Pine64, based on the RK3328 processor.

> ROCK64 is a credit card size 4K60P HDR10 Media Board Computer
powered by Rockchip RK3328 Quad-Core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit Processor
and support up to 4GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 memory. It provides eMMC module
socket, MicroSD Card slot, Pi-2 Bus, Pi-P5+ Bus, USB 3.0 and many
others peripheral devices interface for makers to integrate with
sensors and devices. Various Operating System (OS) are made available
by open source community such Android 7.1, Debian, Yocto and many
more to come.

### Træfik as Kubernetes Ingress Controller on ARM with automatic TLS certificates

Rafael Caricio has a tutorial on using Traefik as a Kubernetes
Ingress Controller for his home bare metal ARM cluster, which is
a mix of Orange Pi PCs and Raspberry Pi boards. His configuration
is a useful setup for those running Kubernetes clusters at home,
particularly because the example provided deals with the
common problem of needing to funnel traffic to a particular
IP address due to network limitations.

> The deployment manifest has a few things you could consider
customizing for your own use. The first part to customize is the
nodeSelector field. Because of my setup I assigned the Traefik Pod
to a specific node of my cluster. In my setup it’s required because
I need a fixed internal IP that I can configure in my router to
redirect all the traffic on the ports 80 and 443 to it. The hostNetwork
field also complies with this requirement. Depending on where and
how you run your Kubernetes cluster you might not have this limitation.
