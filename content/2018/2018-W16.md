## Kubernetes

### arm64 channel on Kubernetes Slack

The Kubernetes project maintains a Slack instance for discussion
across dozens of special interest groups and working groups, as well
as offering support for individual software projects. This week
the #arm64 channel was added for news and questions about running
Kubernetes on 64-bit Arm servers.

### ElasticSearch, Fluentd and Kibana stack on arm64 (Carlos Eduardo)

Carlos Eduardo has a writeup on his effort to get the EFK stack
(Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana) running on an arm64 based
Kubernetes cluster.

> As a proof of concept, I’ve set a full logging aggregation stack
for Kubernetes with ElasticSearch, Fluentd and Kibana on ARM64 SBCs
using my Rock64 Kubernetes cluster. This deployment was based on
this great project by Paulo Pires with some adaptations.

The project repository includes source code, build instructions,
and notes on tuning Java on containers in a relatively low-memory 
environment.

### Performance: "NEON is the new black: fast JPEG optimization on Arm servers"

Vlad Krasnov from Cloudflare writes about his efforts to bring
JPEG performance improvements to their Qualcomm Centriq servers.
He does so by taking advantage of the SIMD (NEON) instructions
in the arm64 instruction set. Vlad walks through some byte-level
vector instructions that substantially improve upon the C language
JPEG processing, taking a benchmark task that took 8.6 seconds 
down to 2.7 seconds. 

> With the new implementation Centriq outperforms the Xeon at batch
reduction for every number of workers. We usually run Polish with
four workers, for which Centriq is now 1.3 times faster while also
6.5 times more power efficient.

### Languages: JDK 10 on arm64

Derek White writes about Java running on 64-bit ARM (AArch64)
systems, such as Cavium ThunderX series processors.

> Oracle has announced the release of Java SE 10.
> The AArch64 Porting Community, including Linaro, Red Hat, Cavium
(with Bellsoft), and others, have added a number of improvements
and bug fixes for AArch64.

### HPC: "HPE Will Supply ARM-Powered HPC Systems to Three UK Universities"

> A trio of UK universities will install a set of HPE Apollo 70
clusters powered by Cavium’s ThunderX2 ARM processors. The effort
is part of a three-year project, known as Catalyst UK, which is
evaluating the potential of ARM-based supercomputing.

The systems will go in at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre
(EPCC) at the University of Edinburgh, the University of Leicester,
and the University of Bristol. Bristol is also currently home of Isambard,
the first production Arm-based supercomputer from Cray. They will
run SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) for HPC.

### Jobs: Internships at Arm (Cambridge, UK)

Filippo Spiga writes that he is looking for people interested in
an internship experience at Arm Research - Software and Large
Scale Systems team - in Cambridge (UK).  The team is working on 
hardware-software co-design for high-performance computing, vectorization 
techniques, and evaluation and characterization of genomic workload.

> We are seeking highly motivated interns to join ARM’s Research
team to work on a variety of cutting-edge research for spring,
summer, or fall-term placements.  Our architecture and systems
research activities cover a wide range of disciplines including
mobile and laptop personal computing and applications; server,
cloud, and HPC computing; emerging memory technologies; interconnects;
throughput and vector computing; formal design methods and security;
exploiting parallelism with vector, SIMD, throughput, and multicore
architecture; and machine learning and computer vision.  Exceptional
candidates can experience firsthand how Arm shapes an ecosystem of
more than one thousand partners that ship over 10 billion leading-edge
Arm-powered processors each year.
