### Project Crostini to bring Linux VMs to Chrome OS ?

Project Crostini is an effort to bring Linux virtual machines to
the Chrome OS which powers Google's arm64 and x86 based Chromebooks.
The effort appears to be targeted at developers who could
then easily bring up a Linux shell on their low-cost laptop.

An eagle-eyed reader spotted the announcement in the Chromium
source code change log, with the reviewer comment
"starting VMs will require some skill and patience".

### LLVM 6.0.0

LLVM 6.0.0 is the latest release of this compiler for C and C++.
The new release brings "retpoline" mitigation for the Spectre 
bug, as well as a host of other improvements described in the release notes.

Work has been underway to speed up builds of LLVM on arm64, using
hardware through the Works on Arm cluster and build infrastructure
developed by Linaro and Arm. An update on this effort will be presented
at Linaro Connect in March and at EuroLLVM in April.

### Oracle Linux for arm64 based on 4.14 kernel with GCC 7

Oracle has an openly available technology preview of Oracle Linux for arm64,
based on the 4.14 kernel with the GCC 7 compiler. Wim Coekaerts 
provides updates.

### Monitoring an Arm Kubernetes cluster with Prometheus and Grafana

Carlos Eduardo has published a writeup of monitoring his arm64 Kubernetes
cluster using Prometheus and Grafana. The text is accompanied by a Github
repository with all of the code necessary to run a Prometheus operator on 
Arm. The project aim is to port the official manifests and images to the
Arm platform, thus making a separate distribution unnecessary.

### Kube-Alive on arm64

Daniel Albuschat built "kube-alive" to help teach himself and others
how Kubernetes behaves under a series of loads. With the help of the
Works on Arm cluster, this code is now available to exercise your 
Kubernetes installation on 32-bit and 64-bit Arm platforms and x86.

Kube-alive lets you test load balancing, self-healing with health checks,
rolling update, and auto-scaling and see how Kubernetes behaves 
when stressed under controlled conditions.

### 24-core Socionext system launches with GeForce graphics

Chip One Stop has started taking orders for Socionext's 24-core desktop
arm64 system. Designed as a developer workstation, this machine is
powered by the SC2A11 chip, providing 24 Cortex-A53 cores, up to 
64GB of memory, and with a PCIe slot for a graphics card.

The device is a collaboration between Linaro, Gigabyte, and Socionext,
and was originally demo'ed at Linaro Connext in San Francisco in fall 2017.

### HummingBoard, CuBox updated with i.MX8M system-on-module

SolidRun has refreshed its HummingBoard and CuBox lines of
single-board and mini PC computers with the latest i.MX8M
system-on-module from NXP. Linux Gizmos reviews the details
of these devices and notes that the Quad version of the i.MX8M
module can be expanded to 4GB of memory with Cortex-A53 cores.

System-on-module designs put the entirety of the processor
infrastructure on a single small "mezzanine" style board,
with I/O and other peripherals generally found on a carrier board.
This allows for a degree of upwards compatibility when processors
are improved but I/O requirements are not changed.

### Water-cooled ARMv8 system at Supercomputing Frontiers Europe

Ronald Luitjen will be demonstrating his water-cooled ARMv8
high performance computing system at Supercomputing Frontiers Europe
in Warsaw. A short video posted to Twitter shows 720 cores
in 30 nodes running the Linpack benchmark in about 1.5 kilowatts of power.

Supercomputing Frontiers Europe 2018 is the first European edition
of Singapore's annual Supercomputing Frontiers Conference, now also
in Warsaw, Poland. This HPC event will be held March 12-15, 2018.

### Ceph cluster on Odroid C2 to demo at Chemnitzer Linuxtage 

S. Bretschneider is preparing an Odroid C2 cluster running Ceph
to demo at Chemnitzer Linuxtage. Ceph is a distributed file system
with good arm64 support. 

Chemnitz Linux Days is held March 10-11 in Chemnitz, Germany.
Follow this conference online with the hashtag #CLT2018.

### Flatcar Linux is a fork of CoreOS

After CoreOS was acquired by Red Hat, a Berlin-based consultancy
has forked the project and is offering continued commercial support
for it. The announcement from Kinvolk's Chris Kuehl promises 
that the distribution will be built independently from CoreOS,
and will not depend on upstream binary artifacts for its release.

### Chai open-source Mali GPU driver

Alyssa Rosenzweig continues work on an open-source driver for
the Mali T700 GPU series. The work picks up from where the "Lima" project
left off. Typical GPU drivers for Mali are binary blobs, but Rosenzweig
has made good progress to reverse engineer an assembler language
and to implement a shader in it.
