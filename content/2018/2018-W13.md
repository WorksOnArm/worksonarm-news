### HypriotOS 1.8.0

HypriotOS is a Debian based distribution for the Raspberry
Pi specifically designed and configured to make it easy
to run container-based workloads with Docker on the Pi.
Stefan Scherer and Dieter Reuter head up the development
work.

> This release works on all Raspberry Pi models (1, 2, 3, 3 B+,
Zero, Zero W & Compute Module) as the Docker Engine 18.03.0-ce is
built for ARMv6.

### Plex media server on Raspberry Pi with Docker (MagPi April 2018)

The MagPi is the official magazine for the Raspberry Pi.
It comes out monthly and is available both online and in
print.

The New MagPi of April 2018 has a beginner’s guide to Docker on ARM Raspberry Pi,
using the example of running the Plex media server in a container.

The issue also includes news of a Pi based OpenAuto Android Auto
emulator, plus extensive coverage of the new Pi 3 B+.

### Humbox, a tiny/robust VM driver (work in progress)

Gustavo Niemeyer is working on Humbox, a tiny and
robust driver for virtual machines written in Go
designed to be an easy way to carve up multicore
system (like Packet's Cavium ThunderX 96-core Type 2A)
into a bunch of smaller VMs for testing or continuous
integration work.

Humbox will become part of Spread, the underlying drivers
for a continuous integration and testing system used by
Canonical's Snapcore.

### Elastic stack with Fluentd, ElasticSearch and Kibana (work in progress)

Carlos Eduardo is working on the EFK stack (ElasticSearch,
Fluentd, and Kibana) for his Rock64 based cluster. The
cluster ran a bit hot until he added two substantial
cooling fans to the build. This is work in progress,
and we'll look for a full writeup to come.

### Olimex Lime A64

The Olimex Lime A64 is a quad-core A53 based system
from the Bulgarian Olimex company. The Armbian project
has been working on mainline Linux kernel support.

### Allwinner VPU support in Linux

Bootlin's project to build an open source driver for
the Allwinner video chip is progressing nicely, with
a writeup in Phoronix describing work to date. At
the moment, the target board is correctly displaying
the images, but there's still considerable work to be
done on X11 and Wayland drivers and wringing the most
performance out of the effort.

### Emulating a Commodore 64 in hardware

In small systems news, Frank Bösing has demonstrated
a complete emulation of the vintage Commodore 64
home computer in hardware. He uses the Teensy 3.6,
a 32 bit 180 MHz Arm Cortex-M4 processor with floating point unit,
to faithfully recreate the SID sound synthesis chip
on the C64. A few bits of glue logic later and you can
run C64 games on an attached display, titles like

* Boulder Dash
* Galaxian
* Dig Dug
* Donkey Kong
* Mario Bros
* Paperboy
* PAC-MAN
* Zaxxon

The full source code for the project is available on Github,
some assembly required.
