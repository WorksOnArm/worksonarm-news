## Operating systems

### Alpine Linux 3.8.0 released

Alpine Linux 3.8.0 has been released. The new release supports
netboot on all platforms and add a Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+ support.
Software updates include a Linux 4.14 kernel, and new
language support with Go 1.10, Node.js 8.11 (LTS), Rust 1.26,
Ruby 2.5, PHP 7.2, ghc 8.4, Node.js 8.11 (LTS), OCaml 4.06, R 3.5, and
JRuby 9.2.

Alpine Linux founder Natanael Copa will be presenting on 
"Learn more about Alpine OS from its Founder" at the Cambridge, England
Docker offices on July 23, 2018.

### Porting Redox to aarch64

Redox is a Unix-like microkernel operating system written in the programming language Rust.
Ioannis Valasakis writes in Medium about the process of porting this operating system
to the A53-based Raspberry Pi, and discusses architectural issues necessary to
understand to get this work started.

### Linaro Enterprise Reference Platform 18.06

From the release notes:

> The goal of the Linaro Enterprise Reference Platform is to provide a fully tested, end to end, documented, open source implementation for ARM based Enterprise servers. The Reference Platform includes kernel, a community supported userspace and additional relevant open source projects, and is validated against existing firmware releases. The Linaro Enterprise Reference Platform is built and tested on Linaro Enterprise Group members hardware and the Linaro Developer Cloud. It is intended to be a reference example for use as a foundation for members and partners for their products based on open source technologies. The members and partners to include distribution, hyperscaler or OEM/ODM vendors, can leverage the reference for ARM in the datacenter.

The kernel is 4.16 based, including backports of already upstreamed patches to fix issues discovered during QA.
Enterprise components include
Apache Bigtop upstream (Hadoop v2.8.4, Zookeeper v3.4.6 Spark v2.2.1, Hive v2.3.3 HBase v1.3.2 Ambari v2.6.1),
ElasticStack / ELK v5.6.9 (from upstream),
OpenJDK 8,
Libvirt 4.3.0, and
QEMU 2.12.

Targeted hardware is the 
Cavium ThunderX,
HiSilicon D03,
HiSilicon D05,
HP Proliant m400, and
Qualcomm Centriq 2400.

## Containers and Kubernetes

### Kubernetes 1.11 release

Kubernetes 1.11 was released on Wednesday, June 27, 2018. The new release adds support
for CoreDNS, a flexible, extensible authoritative DNS server and directly integrates with the Kubernetes API.
It also adds an in-cluster load balancing system based on IPVS (IP Virtual Server) 
with a simpler programming interface than iptables.

## Languages and libraries

### Python 3.7.0 release

Python 3.7.0 has been released. The release notes detail
a number of new features that will be of interest to 
Python developers, and report performance improvements
across the board.

The Python project does not release a full set of Linux
binaries, leaving that operation up to the various 
software distributions for packaging. One such unofficial
distribution for Ubuntu is the "deadsnakes" repository,
which builds Python versions in a PPA for ease of installation
of new versions for testing prior to release support.

### Go 1.11rc1 release

The Go language has an early release of Go 1.11
available for testing. Go 1.11 will have a number
of performance improvements for cryptographic routines
for arm64, and preliminary test results using Go 1.11
show performance and throughput improvements on 
crypto-intensive network operations.

## High performance computing

### ISC18 GoingARM workshop

The ARM HPC world gathered at the GoingARM
workshop at ISC18 in Frankfurt, Germany on Thursday, June 28, 2018. 
Jonathan Beard provided a live tweet of the events using
the #GoingARM hashtag on Twitter. The ISC organizers will 
make the presentation slides available online a week after 
the event, provided as PDF files; we'll review those
when they appear.

### Altair PBS Professional v18

Altair PBS Professional is a job scheduler for HPC
applications. Their v18 release includes arm64 support
targeted at Cavium ThunderX2 based systems used in Altair's 
simulation, machine learning and optimization tools.
