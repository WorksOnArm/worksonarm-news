### Cloudflare: Xeon vs Centriq

The lead photo is Cloudflare's illustration of why they
are happy with the Qualcomm Centriq processors. Two systems
are handling identical loads, and the Centriq consumes 1/3 less
power than the Xeon. Cloudflare operates a global edge
network with a workload that's highly parallel, and
they have done work to optimize the Go compiler for arm64.

The Twitter threads linked below are entertaining,
and hint at a more detailed blog post to follow.

### Linaro Connect videos and news coverage

Linaro Connect was in Hong Kong this week, and videos are
up from the event. Linaro.ORG has official videos of
keynotes and will have all session details up within a week
or two. Video blogger Charbax from ArmDevices.NET has
several interviews from the show floor and from attendees
of work they have in progress.

Linaro Connect is traditionally a time to announce new
devices, and this event is no exception. Charbax does
a good job of walking the show floor and talking to 
people who are representing new gear.

### Linaro Connect: Socionext Synquacer development box

At the fall 2017 Linaro Connect, Socionext showed their
new Synquacer development box for Arm. In Hong Kong, the
keynote from Daniel Thompson was an account of using
the system - a 24-core, 1 Ghz A53 design - as his daily
development workstation.

Socionext has announced pricing for this system. A $1250
kit (some assembly required) gets you a 4GB system with a
1TB HDD. Daniel Thompson's configuration expanded the 
memory (the box can handle up to 64 GB) and replaced
the spinning disk with an SSD.

Peter Robinson from Fedora was also at the show and
demoed installing Fedora Rawhide (the latest and greatest
version) on this system.

### Linaro Connect: Rock960 Enterprise Edition "Ficus"

The Rock960 "Ficus" is a 96Boards design with a new
configuration using the Arm-designed NPU ("Neural Processing 
Unit") designed for AI and machine learning applications.
This $99 (base price) board includes a Rockchip RK3399Pro and up to
4 GB of memory in a full configuration.

### Linaro Connect: 96Boards HiKey 970 AI platform with Arm NPUs

The Huawei and Linaro designed HiKey 970 is a successor to the
$239 HiKey 960 development board. It features the HiSilicon Kirin 970
SoC found in the high-end Huawei Mate 10 Android phone, and has
an 8-core design (4xA73 + 4xA53) with 6 GB of RAM and a dedicated
Neural Processing Unit for AI and machine learning applications.

### Linaro Connect: Microsoft Azure on Arm Servers

Daniel Bowers (Gartner analyst) comments on Leendert van Doorn's 
Linaro Connect keynote "Microsoft Azure: Operating at Hyper-Scale": 
"We've legitimized ARM servers (but there won't be a retail version of Windows Server for ARM)."

### OCP: ThunderX2 workstation from Gigabyte and Cavium

At the Open Computer Platform Summit this week, Gigabyte
and Cavium announced a deskside workstation version of their
ThunderX2 system. The announcement did not include prices
or availability.

### "Project Fin": Resin.io carrier board for Raspberry Pi compute module

Resin.IO has designed a carrier board for the Raspberry Pi 3 compute
module, a design intended for its industrial customers. "Project Fin"
brings a real time clock, a power controller for 6V to 30V operations, 
a SIM slot, a PCIe slot, and eMMC memory to the Pi. 

A Samsung Artik 020 micro-controller is included as a co-processor, 
designed to run at all times even if the main compute module is
shut down. This allows the board to operate at very low standby
power running off of the micro-controller (e.g. for data logging
applications) and then power up the system to handle processing as needed.

This industrial scale compute board is expected to go on sale this
spring for $129, plus the cost of the compute module ($25 to $30).

### Raspberry Pi and Stephen Hawking (Eben Upton)

Raspberry Pi founder Eben Upton is interviewed about the Raspberry Pi 3 B+,
forthcoming plans for the Raspberry Pi 4, and how Stephen Hawking used
a Raspberry Pi based system near the end of his life to provide his
distinctive voice.

### Apache Mesos on Arm: first successful CI builds

Tomasz Janiszewski reports that the Apache Mesos builds for Arm 
are now passing, setting the stage for a possible future
official support for Mesos on Arm.

### LuaJIT optimization work in progress

Cloudflare has funded work to optimize LuaJIT for arm64,
through a team at Kings College London.
