### Ubuntu 18.04 LTS "Bionic Beaver" released on April 26

The latest Ubuntu 18.04 LTS release was announced on April 26, 2018.

> Codenamed "Bionic Beaver", 18.04 LTS continues Ubuntu's proud tradition
of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a
high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution. The team has been hard at
work through this cycle, introducing new features and fixing bugs.

> Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS includes the Queens release of OpenStack
including the clustering enabled LXD 3.0, new network configuration via
netplan.io, and a next-generation fast server installer. 

The Ubuntu archive for arm64 contains 75334 software packages, with
many of them updated since the last 16.04 LTS release.

### CentOS 7.5.1804 and Continuous Release packages

If you are running CentOS on Arm and are interested in upgrading to
the latest, the arm-dev list for CentOS has instructions how to pull
your release forward. The necessary changes reflect the new
CentOS release environment which now provides CR ("Continuous Release")
packages for Arm systems.

> In the past, we built for all architectures through different build
systems, but for this new 7.5.1804 release (rebuilt from 7.5) we started
to use a new build process to build for all arches in parallel through
one single build system.

### MirageOS

> MirageOS is a library operating system that constructs unikernels
for secure, high-performance network applications across a variety
of cloud computing and mobile platforms. Code can be developed on
a normal OS such as Linux or MacOS X, and then compiled into a
fully-standalone, specialized unikernel that runs under a Xen or
KVM hypervisor.

Instructions are provided for booting MirageOS on your A53-based
single-board computer. The system is programmed in OCaml.

### SHA-3 in Armv8.4-A

SHA-3 is a cryptographic hashing function. The 2017 extensions to
the Arm architecture known as Armv8.4-A include hardware support
for the SHA-3 algorithm.

Is SHA-3 slow? It can be, when implemented in software, compared
to other hashing algorithms. When done in FPGAs or implemented
directly in processor hardware, though, the conclusion is very
different:

> Throughput for a given circuit area is an order of magnitude
higher than SHA-2 or any of the SHA-3 finalists. And if you care
beyond plain speed, note that it also consumes much less energy per
bit.

### Docker Consul

Docker Consul is a distributed key-value store. Work has been
committed to bring this to a multiarch Docker container.

### LuaJIT light userdata

LuaJIT supports a 47-bit data type which is used to store
pointers as "light userdata". This conflicts with the 48-bit
data type in arm64 systems, and so work is necessary.

Peter van Dijk (@Habbie) has the following suggestions
and recommendations for effectively addressing this issue:

> Where addresses (the address of a type_info) were used as indexes,
we replaced those with (semi-human readable) strings (the mangled
type names) 

> Where addresses needed to be stored for later retrieval, we boxed
them in a full userdata 

> Where we were using addresses as indexes but really didn't need to,
we replaced that with luaL_ref

Habbie's work is going into PowerDNS, an open source name
server and resolver software.

### Fedora 28 for Raspberry Pi 3 B+

Peter Robinson has a good detailed writeup on the port of Fedora 28
to the new Raspberry Pi 3 B+.

> The upcoming Fedora 28 GA release will support the Raspberry Pi
3 B+ to the same levels as the original 3 B on both ARMv7 and
aarch64.

The new components on the board include a USB hub, Gigabit ethernet,
and Wifi changes, which consumed most of the work for the porting efforts.
