### ConnectTech rack-mount NVIDIA Jetson system

Connect Tech and USES Integrated Solutions partnered to create a 
scalable array server, which contains 24 NVIDIA® Jetson™ TX2/TX1 modules. 
Three array boards house eight Jetson TX2/TX1 modules each, all connected 
via a Gigabit Ethernet fabric through a specialized managed Ethernet Switch 
developed by Connect Tech with 10G uplink capability (XDG201).

Connect Tech develops carrier products for the Jetson
"supercomputer on module", packaging the boards and
adding additional sensors, case and power supply components
to meet embedded systems needs. The server packaging is
due to a partnership with USES Integrated.

The Jetson TX2 from NVIDIA is a 7.5-watt supercomputer on a module
It's built around an NVIDIA Pascal™-family GPU and comes with 8 GB of 
memory and 59.7 GB/s of memory bandwidth.

### Rockchip RK3399 support planned for Fedora 29

Peter Robinson from the Fedora project reports as follows:

> So I've finally managed to sort out a bunch of the issues on 
Rockchip rk3399 #aarch64 devices, just putting the final bits 
of polish and working out a few details and should hopefully 
get support landed just in time for @fedora 29!

The RK3399 is found in single-board computers like the 4GB
"NanoPC-T4" from FriendlyElec and the "RockPro-64" from
Pine64. It features a 6-core BIG.little
architecture with Dual Cortex-A72 + Quad Cortex-A53 cores.
System designs top out at 4GB of dual-channel LPDDR4 system memory.

### LLVM with support for AArch64 v8.5A architecture

The 2018 release of the AArch64 architecture, known
as Armv8.5-A, incorporates support in hardware for
security vulnerability detection, memory tagging, and
improved virtual machine performance. Hardware with
support for this newest architecture is not yet
available, but software development for it has begun,
specifically targeting development tools like the LLVM
compiler suite.

ProteasWang writes on Twitter:

> AArch64 v8.5A patches have started to land, including MC layer support for 
PSTATE manipulation, new FRINT instructions, a speculation barrier, 
prediction invalidation instructions, branch target identification instructions, 
and more.

Additional information can be found in the LLVM Weekly News issue 248
of October 1, 2018.

### Adopt OpenJDK with new support for OpenJDK 11

The Adopt OpenJDK project has announced support for
OpenJDK 11 on a variety of platforms including arm64.
The AdoptOpenJDK community provides prebuilt OpenJDK binaries from a 
fully open source set of build scripts and infrastructure.
