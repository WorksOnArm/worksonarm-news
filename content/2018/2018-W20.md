### Fedora 28 release

Fedora 28 was released by Red Hat on May 2018. This release
marks the move to support aarch64 (arm64, 64-bit Arm) as a
primary architecture for Fedora Server.

> The headline feature for Fedora 28 Server is the inclusion of the
new Modular repository. This lets you select between different
versions of software like NodeJS or Django, so you can chose the
stack you need for your software.

### Cavium ThunderX2 review (SemiAccurate, Next Platform)

SemiAccurate and The Next Platform have extended reviews
of Cavium ThunderX2 hardware, with detailed architectural
views alongside competitive analysis of server chips vs
other popular systems.

> In the end what do we have with the Thunder X2? We have an ARM
server that can run with the big boys, Intel and AMD, on a socket
level if not on a single thread level, and lacks little if anything
on features. This isn’t to say single threaded performance is weak,
it isn’t, but it is the single area that Intel can still shine at.
For now. Cavium’s Thunder X2 is more than good enough for the
overwhelming majority of the market.

### Visual Studio 2017 15.8 with Arm64 support

Developers for Windows 10 can start to target the
arm64 platform with the latest 15.8 release of
Visual Studio. InfoQ has a preview.

> With 15.8, developers can now start having their projects target
the ARM64 platform.  This support covers C++ UWP applications, .NET
Native UWP apps, and Win32 apps written in C++.  In order to enable
this support, you will need to select the "C++ Universal Windows
Platform Tools for ARM64" Individual Component from the Visual
Studio Installer.  It should be noted that as this is still
pre-release, ARM64 apps cannot be uploaded to the Microsoft Store.

### xgo, a cross-compiler for Go CGO programs

xgo is a cross-compiler for Go programs that use CGO features.
It looks to handle the common case where you want to create
binaries for a wide range of systems, and is delivered with
the help of Docker images that bundle up the toolchains for
each of those systems.

### FastNetMon release for arm64 on Ubuntu systems

FastNetMon is a fast DDoS analyzer with sflow/netflow/mirror support.
It is now available as a Ubuntu package installable with apt-get
for arm64 systems.

FastNetMon has been doing its porting work with the help of
the Works on Arm cluster.
