News this week runs the gamut from a top supercomputer
to a new Raspberry Pi model, all running on Arm 
processors.

#### In this issue

* Sandia Labs ASTRA supercomputer in Top500 list
* SUSE Linux for Arm in manufacturing
* OpenBSD/arm64 on QEMU with networking
* RHEL 8 beta on arm64
* hpcDIRECT from Verne Global features ThunderX2 for HPC

### Sandia Labs ASTRA supercomputer in Top500 list

Arm is well represented at this week's SC18 supercomputing
show in Dallas. Leading the news is the appearance of
Sandia's "Astra" supercomputer on the TOP500 ranking of
the world's fastest systems.

> For the first time, an ARM-powered supercomputer has made it into
the TOP500 rankings. The new system, known as Astra, is an HPE-built
supercomputer deployed at Sandia National Laboratories. It’s powered
by 125,328 Cavium ThunderX2 cores and has achieved an HPL Linpack
score of 1.5 petaflops. It enters the list at number 205.

### SUSE Linux for Arm in manufacturing

The first success story of a SUSE customer using SLES for Arm on a 
Raspberry Pi to improve manufacturing efficiency has been published here,
via Jay Kruemcke from SUSE.

> Knorr-Bremse chose to use Raspberry Pi devices to collect data from 
manufacturing machines. The small, inexpensive singleboard computers are 
ideal for building connected IoT solutions. Next, the company selected 
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for ARM as the operating system to 
support its innovative Raspberry Pi project.

### OpenBSD/arm64 on QEMU with networking

0x16h (Cryogenix) has a nice writeup on getting an emulated
arm64 system running OpenBSD running under QEMU. The system
was set up to support writing a tutorial on assembly language
programming for OpenBSD with an emphasis on development for
the kernel.

### RHEL 8 beta on arm64

RHEL 8 is derived from Fedora 28 and 29 and features a Linux 4.18
kernel. This beta includes full support for arm64 systems as a
"first class citizen".

You can test the new features of RHEL 8 before general availability
if you have an active Red Hat subscription.

### hpcDIRECT from Verne Global features ThunderX2 for HPC

> LONDON and DALLAS, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Verne Global, a provider
of advanced data center solutions for high performance computing
(HPC), today announced the expansion of hpcDIRECT, its optimized
bare-metal infrastructure solution, to include servers with Arm®-based
Marvell® ThunderX2 processors.

### Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+

The Raspberry Pi Foundation has announced a new model of their
familiar single-board computer. The $25 Pi 3 Model A+ runs as
fast as the Model 3 B+, but has less RAM (512GB) and fewer ports
(no Ethernet and only one USB). It may find itself filling a
sweet spot in your next embedded development project.

### Windows 10 official support for arm64 development tools

Microsoft has announced Windows 10 support for native arm64
applications as of the release of Visual Studio 15.9. These
apps will target the new laptop devices powered by Qualcomm
Snapdragon chips.

> Developers can use Visual Studio 15.9 today to recompile apps –
both UWP and C++ Win32 – to run natively on Windows 10 on ARM
devices. Running natively allows applications to take full advantage
of the processing power and capabilities of Windows 10 on ARM
devices, resulting in the best possible experience for users.
