### CES, the Consumer Electronics Show

The annual CES show in Las Vegas brings with it spectacle,
vigorous self-promotion, and a hint of what is coming in
the coming year. Two announcements stood out from the hype
this year: NVIDIA's powerful new self-driving car platform,
and a retro clamshell Android device, both powered by 64-bit
Arm cores.

### CES: NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier 

Self-driving cars require lots of computing power to
integrate information coming from high speed sensors
plus deep learning for feature recognition. NVIDIA
announced the "DRIVE Xavier" system-on-chip to power
their latest self-driving platform, with a newly designed 8-core
64-bit custom Arm CPU. NVIDIA writes:

> It’s built around a custom 8-core CPU, a new 512-core Volta GPU,
a new deep learning accelerator, new computer vision accelerators
and new 8K HDR video processors. And with our unified architecture,
all previous NVIDIA DRIVE software development carries over and
runs.

NVIDIA has developer kits available for sale - the Jetson TX1 and TX2 -
which are from a previous generation of CPU designs. As far as
I've been able to determine the new custom Arm SoCs are not
yet available in development kit designs, but the new hardware
is promised to be compatible with all provided libraries and software.

### CES: Psion remake, Planet Computers "Gemini"

The 1990s saw the temporary popularity of computing devices
from Psion, which offered a clamshell design with a small full
keyboard hinged to a modest sized screen. The clamshell approach
is enough smaller than a laptop that you can put it in your pocket,
but with a large enough keyboard to not need an on-screen keyboard
for your typing. At CES in Las Vegas, there is an attempt to revive
this form factor from Planet Computers.

It's a tricky combo to get right, and the original Psion designers
are back at it with the "Gemini", a hinged system with a 1080p screen
and compact keyboard. Originally funded via Indiegogo, this device
runs on a 10-core MediaTek Helio X27 processor with 4GB of ram and 
two USB-C ports. The promise is that when it ships it will run some
flavor of Linux to go along with the stock Android release, but no
distribution support details are forthcoming yet.

The BBC has a video interview with designer Martin Riddiford
who walks us through the intended use of the system, both as
a phone for taking and making calls and as a little Android
laptop. 

The Indiegogo offering raised $1.4 million, and at CES the
product won "Slashgear Editor’s Choice Best of CES 2018 award".

Availability of the system is unclear from any of the media reports.

### Spectre and Meltdown roundup

Fallout continues from the Spectre and Meltdown attacks on a wide
range of computing systems. Patches mitigating some of these cases
are emerging.

FreeBSD has announced mitigations for variants of Spectre on on
Cortex-A57, A72, A73, and A75. They write:

> It has been reported the ThunderX
is unaffected, however the ThunderX2 is vulnerable. The Qualcomm
Falkor core is also affected. As FreeBSD doesn't yet run on the
ThunderX2 or Falkor no workaround is included for these CPUs.

Network World runs a story about Meltdown and Spectre's impact on 
AMD and Arm, and concludes that "thankfully, is not much, but it is there."

Red Hat has a three minute presentation on Spectre and Meltdown, using
the analogy of the "Speculation Diner" to describe speculative execution
and branch prediction.
