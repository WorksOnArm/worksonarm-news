### Nextcloud benchmarks

"Nextcloud, by its nature, scales extremely well across multiple cores 
and our tests show up to 50% better performance than a similarly priced Intel system."

Using equipment provided by the Works on Arm program, Nextcloud
evaluated their file sharing server software on Cavium ThunderX hardware.

## High-performance computing

### Sandia "Astra" supercomputer

HPCwire writes: "On track for deployment at Sandia National Labs later this year as part of the NNSA’s Arm-centric Vanguard project, Astra will be the world’s largest Arm system ever built, according to HPE." 

The Astra system will incorporate HPE Apollo 70 nodes - 2,592 two-socket systems
using a 28 core variant of the ThunderX2 processor that runs at 2 GHz - for
a total of 145,152 cores in the design. Storage will be provided by an all-flash 
Lustre parallel file system based on HPE’s Apollo 4250 storage server nodes, and
networking uses a 100 Gb/sec EDR InfiniBand interconnect from Mellanox Technologies.

### Fujitsu Post-K

The Fujitsu Post-K project is design to "create the world's highest-performing supercomputer, 
capable of tackling a broad range of applications to solve problems not only in the 
area of science and technology, but to play a role in a wide variety of issues in society."

To accomplish this goal, Fujitsu has worked to design an Armv8-A CPU with 512-bit SVE scalable
vector extensions. It is targeted to run Linux (RHEL-based) plus the McKernel, a lightweight kernel
developed at RIKEN specifically for low-overhead high performance computing.

The Post-K prototype will be exhibited at ISC 2018, a significant international conference and exhibition for high performance computing, which will be held in Germany from June 24-28.

## Single-board computers and arm64 desktops

### TERES-I laptop from Olimex booting Armbian

TERES-I is a DIY Free Open Source Hardware and Software laptop with arm64 and x86 processors from Olimex.
The arm64 system is based on an Allwinner A64 CPU. The Armbian project reports that they
have this system booting into the Armbian Stretch desktop from an SD card.

### NanoPC-T4

The NanoPC-T4 is a Rockchip RK3399 based arm64 board from FriendlyArm. 
It has 4GB LPDDR3 RAM, 16GB eMMC flash, onboard 2.4G & 5G dual-band WiFi 
module and a full standard M.2 PCIe interface which supports an NVME SSD high-speed hard drive.

### 64-bit TianoCore UEFI for the Raspberry Pi 3 (with devices, Linux, FreeBSD and Windows on Arm!)

Andrei Warkentin (@andreiw on Github) has a port of 64-bit TianoCore 
UEFI firmware for the RPi3/RPi3B+ platforms, based on Ard Bisheuvel's 
64-bit and Microsoft's 32-bit implementations.
This is meant as a generally useful 64-bit UEFI implementation 
for the Pi3, good enough for most kinds of UEFI development and 
good enough for running real operating systems.

TianoCore is an open source implementation of the Unified 
Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), a critical piece of firmware 
used during the boot process on modern server systems.

### Macchiatobin booting Windows 10

Andrei Warkentin reports success booting Windows 10 using
stock UEFI 17.10 on a Macchiatobin 'Single Shot' board from
Solid Run. He writes "lightning fast boot compared to Pi 3".

### NEMS Linux

NEMS is Nagios Enterprise Monitoring Server for Single Board Computers. 
It is a modern pre-configured, customized and ready-to-deploy Nagios 
Core image designed to run on low-cost micro computers. At its core 
NEMS is a lightweight Debian Stretch deployment optimized for 
performance, reliability and ease of use.

NEMS targets the Raspberry Pi hardware, and has recently been ported to
the Pine A64+.

## Cluster computing

### Kubernetes dashboard on Arm with RBAC

"In the recent guide about setting up Kubernetes 1.9.0 using kubeadm on Raspberry Pis, RBAC was enabled by default. This blog post will show how to run the Kubernetes dashboard with RBAC enabled."

## Languages, compilers, and libraries

### flang work in progress (Fortran compiler for LLVM)

"Flang is to Fortran as Clang is to C/C++."

Flang is a Fortran compiler that targets the LLVM compiler back end.
Work is in progress with code contributed by Cavium to port Flang to
arm64, as noted on the "flang-compiler" Github repository.

### LLVM Developers Meeting, October 17-18 2018, San Jose

John Regehr writes: "PSA for students and professors doing LLVM-related research: you *really* want to be attending these dev meetings".

The LLVM Developers' Meeting is a bi-annual 2 day gathering of the entire LLVM Project community. The conference is organized by the LLVM Foundation and many volunteers within the LLVM community. Developers and users of LLVM, Clang, and related subprojects will enjoy attending interesting talks, impromptu discussions, and networking with the many members of our community. Whether you are a new to the LLVM project or a long time member, there is something for each attendee.
