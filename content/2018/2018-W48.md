## pypy port to arm64 underway

> We are pleased to inform that Arm Limited, together with Crossbar.io GmbH, are sponsoring the development of 64-bit Armv8-a architecture support through Baroque Software OU, which would allow PyPy to run on a new variety of low-power, high-density servers with that architecture. We believe this will be beneficial for the funders, for the PyPy project as well as to the wider community.
