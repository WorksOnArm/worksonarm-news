### ASTRA – A Large Scale ARM64 HPC Deployment (2019 Stanford HPC)

Michael Aguilar from Sandia National Laboratories presents: 
ASTRA – A Large Scale ARM64 HPC Deployment in this presentation from
the 2019 Stanford HPC Conference. The Arm-based system will be used by 
the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) for simulation
and modeling workloads.

### Neoverse N1 (Linley Group) (subscription required)

Linley Gwennap writes about the new Neoverse N1 in the Linley Group's
newsletter (subscription required). Arm is "upping its server game",
but "[D]espite the new brand, the N1 is similar to the recent Cortex-A76 
smartphone CPU." The report notes that a 64-core reference design 
outperforms Intel’s mainstream Xeon processors.

### k3s - minimalist Kubernetes from Rancher Labs

k3s is a lightweight and minimal Kubernetes distribution from Rancher Labs.
It is built for the edge, with an emphasis on removing unneeded functions
and features and simplifying binary distributions down to a single executable
that will fit in a memory footprint as small as 512 MB. k3s will run on 
32-bit and 64-bit Arm systems, as well as x86 systems.

k3s is the subject of an upcoming Rancher Meetup discussion and live demo on 
Wednesday, March 13th, 2019 at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, hosted by
Rancher co-founders Shannon Williams and Darren Shepherd.

### Apache Bigtop on aarch64 via ODPi (Linaro Connect Bangkok)

Apache Bigtop is a project for the development of packaging and 
tests of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. 
ODPi, a non-profit focused on the Hadoop ecosystem, will present
on the current state of the big data software universe
at Linaro Connect in Bangkok the week of April 1, 2019.

### Project Photon OS update (VMware)

Project Photon is a minimal lightweight Linux distribution designed 
for containers and cloud native technology. In a Photon 3.0 release,
the project adds support for arm64 systems and for the 
Raspberry Pi. Photon OS is a project of VMware's Open Source team.

### Civil Infrastructure Platform (Linux Foundation)

The Civil Infrastructure Platform is a Linux Foundation project
aimed at "establishing an open source base layer of industrial 
grade software to enable the use and implementations of reusable 
software building blocks that meet the safety, reliability and 
other requirements of industrial and civil infrastructure."

A new reference platform adds "super long term support" (SLTS)
for the Linux kernel, aiming at implmentations that will be
fielded for 10 years. Renesas has contributed both a reference
hardware design and arm64 support for this kernel, which is based
on Linux 4.19.
