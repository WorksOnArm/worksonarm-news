### ASTRA – A Large Scale ARM64 HPC Deployment (2019 Stanford HPC)

Michael Aguilar from Sandia National Laboratories presents: 
ASTRA – A Large Scale ARM64 HPC Deployment in this presentation from
the 2019 Stanford HPC Conference. The Arm-based system will be used by 
the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) for simulation
and modeling workloads.

### Neoverse N1 (Linley Group) (subscription required)

Linley Gwennap writes about the new Neoverse N1 in the Linley Group's
newsletter (subscription required). Arm is "upping its server game",
but "[D]espite the new brand, the N1 is similar to the recent Cortex-A76 
smartphone CPU."

### k3s - minimalist Kubernetes from Rancher Labs

k3s is a lightweight and minimal Kubernetes distribution from Rancher Labs.
It is built for the edge, with an emphasis on removing unneeded functions
and features and simplifying binary distributions down to a single executable
that will fit in a memory footprint as small as 512 MB.

k3s is the subject of an upcoming Rancher Meetup discussion and live demo on 
Wednesday, March 13th, 2019 at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, hosted by
Rancher co-founders Shannon Williams and Darren Shepherd.
