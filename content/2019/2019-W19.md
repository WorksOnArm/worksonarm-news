### RHEL 8 release

RHEL 8 was announced at Red Hat Summit in Boston. This is the
first release of RHEL that is available on Arm server systems,
and the last release of RHEL before Red Hat's acquisition by
IBM. Red Hat has a single codebase for all of RHEL 8, that supports
all of their supported operating systems on all architectures -
no forks, special spins, or feature branches needed.

### Neoverse N1 server running Fedora 30 at Red Hat Summit

At Red Hat Summit, the Fedora team showed off a research prototype
workstation running with a 4-core Neoverse N1 chip. The
system was based on a 5.1 kernel running Fedora 30. This
particular board is not expected to ever be in wide production,
but it does let OS vendors get hands-on experience with
new IP and new silicon so that when licensees are ready
for production the software will be well tested.

### Scaling results from the first generation of Arm supercomputers

At the Cray User Group conference in Montreal, a team
led by Simon McIntosh-Smith of the University of Bristol won "best paper" for their
work on scaling results from the first generation of
Arm-based supercomputers (Isambard).

### glibc improvements for Marvell ThunderX2

Marvell has contributed improvements to glibc for the ThunderX2
that speed up memmove performance by up to 30% on large
forward moves. The code is specific to that platform, but
should be adaptable to any system where SIMD instructions
perform well. Similar optimizations are already in place
in that code base for Qualcomm's now-defunct Falkor cores.

### ODroid N2 review

Carlos Eduardo reviews the Amlogic powered ODroid N2 and finds
it a third faster than the Rockchip RK3399 for his set of
real world sample tasks.

### Building a Kubernetes-ready kernel for the Jetson Nano (Dieter Reuter)

Dieter Reuter goes through the detail of the process to completely rebuild
your kernel on the Jetson Nano, in order to enable Kubernetes operations on
that system. A full kernel rebuild is about an hour's compile time on this
quad-core A57-based 4 GB memory system.

### Mozilla fixes Firefox add-ons in "armagadd-on" bug

The Mozilla team has resolved a set of issues that cause user add-ons
in their popular Firefox browser to stop working. The post-mortem points
to an expired certificate as contributing to the problem. Firefox Beta
is available as a native Window 10 on Arm build for arm64 Windows systems.

### Linux 5.1 release

The Linux 5.1 changelog has release notes for this latest kernel release. The
new kernel enables new arm64 hardware, and now defaults to a maximum of 256
cores per system to support high-performance hardware like the Marvell ThunderX2.

### GCC 9

The GCC 9.1 release is out. Among the improvements in it are better link time
optimizations, illustrated in detail in a weblog by Honza Hubicka.

### Arm and RISC-V memory concurrency models

Christopher Pulte's doctoral thesis on ARMv8 and RISC-V multicopy atomic
memory semantics is good reading if you are interested in the
complexities of the memory models of modern processors and
instruction set architectures.

### dav1d speedups

dav1d is a video decoder for the royalty-free AV1 streaming media
format. It has been accelerated in the 0.3 release to improve
performance on Arm systems with new NEON and SIMD codes.

### Windows 10 on Arm - sysinternals utilities

Microsoft teased a version of their `sysinternals` debugging and
process management tools for Windows 10 on Arm.

### rclone

`rclone` is a fast command line utility for file copies,
backups, and restore operations. It supports arm64 systems,
and can be used to effectively manage file transfers across
a number of remote file system protocols.

### Measuring on-chip delays

In multicore and manycore systems, the delay to get data
between pairs of cores in a CPU complex can vary considerably.
Michael Kuron measures these delays in an AMD Threadripper
using the `core-latency` tool from Adam Jakubek. Complex
chip architectures can introduce non-uniform memory
access (NUMA), and as a consequence schedulers need to
be architecture aware to maximize performance.

### Sixel graphics with vt340-compatible terminals

Just when you thought display technology had reached
its apex comes SIXEL, a 1990's technology from the
DEC vt340 terminal that enables simple image graphics
within an otherwise text-only window.

### $199 Pinebook Pro status

Pine64 provides an update to their $199 Pinebook Pro
production efforts. The current boards for this device
have a few minor issues that will be worked out before
the first real production run due within the next couple
of months.

### Swift for Tensorflow on Jetson Nano

A team lead by Brad Larson has produced a version of the Swift language
with support for Tensorflow operations targeting the Jetson Nano.
Swift is a language from Apple used for both client-side and
server-side programming, and Tensorflow is a Google effort for
machine learning.

### npcap

npcap, a packet capture and analysis utility, adds support
for Windows 10 on Arm.

### Animation Compression Library

The Animation Compression Library provides substantial speedups
for animation on a variety of platforms, especially arm64 for
IoS and newly for Windows 10 on Arm. The codebase supports
Linux but has not been ported yet to the linux/arm64 combination.

ACL architect Nicholas Frechette has an interesting weblog to go with
the software development, providing inside into the instruction
set level optimizations, tweaks, and assembly language
deep work needed to make this package perform as well as possible.

### Alpine Linux 3.9.4

Alpine Linux has produced a 3.9.4 release across a number of
platforms including arm64. The latest release addresses a
number of security issues from contributed packages, and
new to this release the CVEs for those security issues are
included in the release notes.
