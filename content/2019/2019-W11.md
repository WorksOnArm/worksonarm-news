### An interview with Gopal Hegde of Marvell (HPCwire)

HPCwire talks to Gopal Hegde, head of Marvell’s Server Processor Business Unit,
identifying him as a "Person to Watch". He talks about the ThunderX2 processor,
partnerships between Marvell and a variety of leading players in the HPC
market from OEMs like Cray to OS providers like RedHat, SuSE, and Canonical,
and plans for the future that include high-performance vector processing
using Arm's SVE (Scalable Vector Extensions).

### Arm N1 system development platform (SDP) (Xilinx, Cadence)

Arm, Xilinx, and Cadence have combined to bring about the Arm N1 System Development Platform (SDP).
This device features the latest Arm N1 silicon on a 7 nm process and uses a
new CCIX chip-to-chip interconnect architecture to interface to devices
like Xilinx's Alveo FPGA accelerator card.

### Why NVidia Bought Mellanox (HPCWire)

NVidia and Mellanox have reached an agreement under which
NVidia will acquire Mellanox for approximately $6.9 billion.
Both companies have strengths in the HPC ("high performance
computing") market, with NVidia providing GPU expertise and
Mellanox a leader in high performance networking. 
The world’s two fastest supercomputers, Sierra and Summit,
use both NVidia and Mellanox gear.

HPCwire looks at the industry response to the corporate
combination from the point of view of HPC vendors, noting
that the combination brings
"advancing high-bandwidth connections for accelerated systems".

### 96Boards: OpenHours with Carl Perry on the DUC

Carl Perry and Ed Vielmetti from Packet and 
David Tischler from miniNodes were guests on
the 96Boards OpenHours, sponsored by Linaro.
The discussion was led by Carl who talked about
a design for an Arm DUC ("developer unit of
computing"), aimed at leveraging existing
standards to bring higher performance systems
to the desktop of Arm developers.
