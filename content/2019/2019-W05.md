## Hardware

### Pinebook Pro laptop

Pine64 has announced a Pinebook Pro laptop with a target price of $199,
to be demoed at FOSDEM and available for order later this year. The laptop
will have a Rockchip RK3399 with 2x A72 + 4x A53 cores in a big.LITTLE 
design, and will feature 4 GB of memory and up to 128 GB of eMMC storage.

### Arm NUC 

Jon Masters from Red Hat discusses the requirements for
an "Arm NUC" to be a developer-ready desktop platform for
arm64 in this Twitter exchange.

## Operating Systems

### ESXi on Arm

The Virtually Speaking Podcast episode 102 talks to VMware ARM
Tech Lead Andrei Warkentin and William Lam, discussing the details
of ESXi on ARM and describing use cases in edge, embedded and IoT.
VMware showed ESXi running on a Raspberry Pi in November 2018.

### Fedora IoT: interview with Peter Robinson on 96Boards open hours

Peter Robinson of the Fedora Project was the featured speaker on
the January 31, 2019 edition of the 96Boards "Open Hours" podcast.
Fedora IoT is a variant of Fedora focused on IoT ecosystems for
applications like home assistants, industrial gateways, or data
storage and analytics.  Peter describes the project in this call
and takes questions about single-board computer design and software
support.

## Performance

### Memory Walls 

Memory performance is limited by hardware architecture, and the
Memory Walls project looks to improve memory performance by trading
off some CPU utilization for better effective memory bandwidth.
Francesc Alted takes on benchmarking several Arm systems including
the Marvell ThunderX2 and the Huawei Kirin 980.

## Languages

### Swift 5 development snapshots

The Swift language is evolving, and the Swift on Arm project
has development snapshots of Swift 5. The new code includes
support for using Tensorflow from Swift.

### Julia Language prize award

The co-inventors of the Julia Language have won the James Wilkinson
Prize for numerical software.  The award will be presented at the
2019 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Computational
Science and Engineering conference (CSE19) in Spokane, Washington.
Feb. 25-Mar 1, 2019.

## Graphics

### Panfrost 

Panfrost is a set of free and open source drivers for Mali Txxxx
and Gxxx GPUs (Midgard and Bifrost). These drivers are
reverse engineered from tracing Arm’s user space 3D
drivers and the open source kernel driver from Arm.
Install instructions require compiling out-of-tree kernel code.

## Retrocomputing

### PiPDP-8, emulator

The PiDP-8/I is a modern replica of the 1968 PDP-8/I computer,
complete with a front panel with blinking lights. A Raspberry
Pi drives the system, and if you have a quad-core Pi 3B you can
set a few of the cores to work an incandescent light simulator
so that the blinking lights appear to glow faithfully.

### Apple II video card with arm64 SoC 

John Brooks from Blue Shift Incorporated has designed a high-performance
video card for the Apple II family. The HDMI output of the VidHD
is driven by a quad-core arm64 processor, which is slaved to the
Apple II bus. A full set of manuals and specifications is available
from Call-A.P.P.L.E, the web site of the Apple Pugetsound Program
Library Exchange.
