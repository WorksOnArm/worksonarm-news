### Using Works on Arm for LLVM development

Arm has posted a blog describing the Works on Arm project
(hosted here at Packet) accelerates open source development
for the LLVM compiler.

### Neoverse N1 and E1 server cores

Arm has announced its Neoverse N1 and E1 server cores.

The N1 (formerly Ares) is a successor to the A7x series and promises
on the order of 2x performance relative to the A72 "Cosmos". Designed
in Austin, Texas, it is similar in high level design to the Cortex-A76.
The N1 features a new CCIX chip interconnect and supports the Armv8.2 ISA.

The E1 is a successor to the
A5x series and promises on the order of 2.5x the performance of the the A53.
The design is very energy efficient, with a design target of less than 200 
milliwatts per core at 2.5 Ghz on a 7 nm process.

### Neoverse system development platform (SDP)

Arm announced development board for its new Neoverse cores.
The System Development Platform (SDP)
is designed for enablement and features four N1
cores and an extensive set of debugging features.
All I/O goes through an FPGA, with a completely
open source firmware stack driving that system.
"Don't expect the board to be easily attainable
for the average user," notes Anandtech, though
qualified partners can expect units to be available in Q1 2019.

### Arm joins Cloud Native Computing Foundation

SAN FRANCISCO – February 19, 2019 – The Cloud Native Computing Foundation 
(CNCF), which sustains open source technologies like Kubernetes and 
Prometheus, today announced that Arm has joined the Foundation as a Gold 
member.
    
Arm is at the heart of billions of wireless, networking, and consumer 
entertainment devices. Last year, Arm teamed up with Packet to provide a 
bare metal backend for developers to build and test open source projects on 
Arm-based infrastructure platforms, which CNCF makes available to open 
source developers via its Community Infrastructure Lab.

### Event: Mobile World Congress, Barcelona, 25-28 Feb 2019

Simon Segars from Arm is a keynote speaker at MWC19
in Barcelona on the topic of "The Next Generation".
Mobile World Congress is an annual gather of telecom
and computer industry leaders in the mobile telephony space.

### BalenaFin carrier board v1.1

Balena (formerly Resin) has announced a full-featured
update for its carrier board for the Raspberry Pi 3
compute module. The BalenaFin includes power management,
a real time clock, dual camera support and Power over
Ethernet (PoE). It is available for order now in limited
quantities for under $200 with a DIN-rail case for 
industrial applications.
