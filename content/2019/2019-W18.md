### Docker buildx for cross-platform builds

At DockerCon 19 in San Francisco this week, Docker announced
a number of enhancements and new features that target the
Arm platform. Among these are a new `buildx` command that
makes it straightforward to cross-build containers for multiple
architectures and to create and push multi-architecture
manifests to registries.

Carlos Eduardo has produced an excellent tutorial on
cross-building arm64 images on your Docker Desktop,
and Ric Harvey has a good writeup on using these
images on Amazon's a1 image types.

### Huawei TaiShan Arm server with Kunpeng 920 (Hi1620) CPU

Huawei announced a TaiShan branded Arm server with
a new Kunpeng 920 CPU. The Kunpeng 920 is the chip
formerly referred to as the HiSilicon Hi1620, and it
features up to 64 ARMv8.2 based cores on a 7nm process.
The chip design includes a CCIX interconnect and PCIe 4.0
interfaces.

### Apache Drill on ARM64

Apache Drill is an open source version of Google's Dremel
project. It supports a variety of NoSQL file systems and
databases and provides a high performance big data query language
and environment. Because Drill is schema free, you can query
complex data types without transforming the data prior to query
execution.

Linaro's BigData team has put together a good introduction to Apache Drill
complete with the instructions necessary to set up your own
three node cluster on a set of arm64 systems, as demoed at Linaro
Connect BKK19 in Bangkok.

### BIND name server updates

Graham Christensen of the NixOS project reports that recent security patches to
the BIND name server use atomic instructions not supported across
all of the architectures that BIND supports, including arm64. A
workaround is available as referenced below, which is being incorporated
back into upstream.

NixOS has a very active porting process which always seeks to bring
in the latest versions of code into their `nixpkgs` distribution system.
As such we often see NixOS as a confirmation and validation step to
ensure that as broad a base of software as possible runs on arm64 systems.

### Parallelism and Jetson Nano (Ray Hightower)

Ray Hightower's presentation at the IndyCode conference looks
at parallel computing on single-board computers including
the Raspberry Pi and the Jetson Nano. It's an interesting
overview that brings forward the applications of algorithms
and computing styles often associated with high performance
computing down to the sub-$100 single-board computer market.

* [Ray Hightower presentation at IndyCode](https://rayhightower.com/blog/2019/04/26/parallelism-and-jetson-nano-at-indycode/)

### DIY Network Video Recorder w/Jetson Nano (Extremetech)

David Cardinal writes for Extremetech about his build of
a do-it-yourself network video recorder based on a Jetson
Nano, the ZoneMinder network video software, and a Honic 4K
network camera. The build discusses the market for network
video and the suitability of various standards to support
this kind of application - apparently not all network
cameras are alike!

### HackerBoards database of single-board computers

HackerBoards has a regularly updated database of
single-board computers from a wide variety of
manufacturers. If you are considering an embedded
Linux build and wish to explore a wide range of
options, it's a good resource.

### Jetson Nano available in UK from Pimoroni

Pimoroni, a UK distributor of single-board computers and
peripherals, has announced their intent to stock the
Jetson Nano for the UK market. Pre-orders will ship on
May 8.

### Docker Hub unauthorized use

The Docker Hub database exposed the sensitive data of over 190,000
users, including authentication keys. Docker Hub users are advised
to rotate their passwords and keys and to check also the status of
the automated systems they have interconnected with such as Github
to ensure that all is in order.

### AIX 5.1 on a sub-$100 Pinebook

AIX 5.1 is a 2001-era release of IBM's Unix-based operating
system, which debuted on the IBM RT in 1986. Thanks to the
magic of the QEMU emulator, it is possible to quite successfully
boot and run AIX on a sub-$100 Pinebook laptop. The emulation
runs PowerPC instructions and full hardware support on the
arm64 cores in the Pinebook, and performance is quite
acceptable as seen by running Doom on this setup.

### OpenRC, a dependency based init system

OpenRC is a dependency based init system used in
a few Linux distributions including Gentoo and
Alpine Linux. It is much, much less complex and
all-encompassing than the `systemd` init that is
in common use, and as such it may be a good
alternative to consider for your resource
constrained or intentionally simplified Linux
run-time environment.

### Conda on Arm

Conda is a thoroughly tested software
distribution focusing on languages for
scientific computing needs, including a
very fine release of Python with a complete
set of scientific libraries like `numpy`
and `scipy`.

Work is underway to make a port of `conda`
to arm64, with discussion actively happening
in the `conda-forge` repository on Github.
Among the considerations are the appropriate
setup and configuration of CI/CD infrastructure
to make sure that everything is tested
carefully before release. Jonathan Helmus has
led quite a bit of this work.

* [conda4aarch64, Jonathan Helmus, Github](https://github.com/jjhelmus/conda4aarch64)

### qrencode

`qrencode` is a library for generating QR codes, those
blocky square codes often useful to convey small bits
of information from your computer screen directly to
your cell phone without retyping. `qrencode` can generate
a wide range of image types, and of particular interest
it is capable of using a Unicode character set to made
QR codes in a terminal window.

* [qrencode](https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/)

### gr-kiwisdr

gr-kiwisdr is a module for the GNU Radio software
that provides an interface to the various KiwiSDR
software-defined radio receivers located around
the world. With this module you can use GNU Radio
for signal analysis without the additional necessity
of connecting a receiver up to your system.

### Jetson Nano serial console cable

The very useful Jetson Hacks weblog has a short note
and some photographs supporting the use of a serial
console cable for the Jetson Nano. Adafruit sells a
handy $10 USB to TTL cable with plugs broken out on
separate wires, giving maximum flexibility for your
Layer 0 experimentations.

### Arm added to CNCF CI dashboard

The CNCF CI project has added arm64 continuous integration
testing to the v2.3.0 of its Kubernetes validation and verification
dashboard. At the moment only Kubernetes is being tested on arm64,
but there are plans to add additional CNCF projects including
CoreDNS in the works.

### Building Chromium on Windows from source

Jeremy Sinclair has a set of notes on building Chromium
on Windows 10 for Arm from sources. Chromium is one of
the most demanding build environments out there, but
Jeremy has successfully navigated it and shares his wisdom.

### Locking under contention

On the Linux kernel mailing list, Linus Torvalds
looks in detail at patches aimed at resolving
an issue with locking under contention that affects
the Marvell ThunderX2 chip. Linus is characteristically
brusque in his assessment of the issue, noting
the architectural issues that face a challenge for
the Linux kernel when you have a very high number
of cores.

* [Linus Torvalds, lkml](https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/1/338)

### Rockchip roadmap

Rockchip has reveals its roadmap for 2019-2020, including
a new flagship 8-core RK3588 designed on an 8nm process.

### How fast are old Arm computers

Marcin Juszkiewicz has been doing Arm kernel development
for quite some time and has in the course of that work
assembled a menagerie of Arm server systems. The working
benchmark of his day is "check out and build a new kernel
from sources", and for this task there has been steady
improvement from old systems to new ones.

### Red Hat Quay 3 container registry with multi-architecture support

Red Hat has announced the Quay 3 version of its container registry.
New in this version is support for multi-architecture containers,
which will newly allow Quay-based projects to properly support
multi-arch builds that include arm64 binaries.

### VS Code for Linux arm64

Visual Studio Code, Microsoft's open source code editor, runs
now on Linux with an arm64 port provided by Jay (headmelted).
I was able to verify correct operations on a Jetson Nano for
the arm64 version, though for some reason on that platform
the automated install instructions did not work. (Download
the .deb files and install with `dpkg`.)

### SIMD speedups for Volk kernel component of GNU Radio

Work is underway to speed up GNU Radio by providing
NEON SIMD support to a variety of kernels used in
signal processing. Initial results show anywhere from a
10% speedup to a 14x speedup, with 3x-5x improvements
being typical. Work is being done by Albin Stigo SM6WJM.
