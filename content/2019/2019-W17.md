### Visual Studio Code for Windows 10 on Arm

I'm using the 32-bit x86 Windows build of VS Code, so
it's running emulated on my Windows 10 on Arm laptop.
So far so good, though I'd much prefer a native version.
This whole newsletter was written with VS Code, with
the help of the `vscode-markdownlint` Markdown lint
tool from David Anson.

The only glitch so far is that it didn't work to create
a terminal window until I followed instructions in a Github
issue to set a flag; from then on, no problems.

### Getting started with the Jetson Nano (Hackster)

Alisdair Allan has a long, no-punches-pulled review
of the Jetson Nano, focusing on the new user experience
of setup. Alisdair is a command-line person, and provides
a comprehensive walk-through from unboxing to setup to
running some machine learning examples. He's not fond
of the Tegra's L4T Linux distribution, writing:

> ... that isn’t any excuse for the awful state of their Linux distribution. The amount of pain it caused both during setup and getting things done was excessive. I don’t think I’ve struggled this hard with a Linux distribution to make it do what I want it to do in a good few years.

His recommendation to Nvidia? Make the introductory experience
focus on tools that data scientists are familiar with - Python,
Tensorflow, and Jupyter Notebooks - rather than C++ code examples.

### Panfrost graphics in Linux 5.2 and support for the Rock960

Panfrost is an open source graphics driver for the Bifrost (Mali-G71)
and Midgard (Mali-T600, Mali-T700, and Mali-T800) series of Arm Mali
graphics coprocessors. The new driver has been added to the DRM-Next
train until the Linux 5.2 kernel merge starts in May. It features basic
OpenGL functionality, but no OpenCL or Vulkan API support.

Sahaj Sarup from 96Boards has tested out this driver, using
the 96Boards Rock960 board. He provides detailed installation
directions and a Youtube video as a proof of work during OpenHours episode 142.

### Kaniko build system for arm64

Lisa Seelye has been porting the Tekton continuous
delivery pipeline to arm64. Tekton is a Kubernetes
based open source framework for CI/CD, originally
part of the knative project but not spun out on its own.

Like many projects coming out of Google, Tekton
has architectural assumptions and build configuration
that are x86-first with minimal affordances provided
at project launch time for multi-architecture and
multi-platform support. Lisa has been systematically
going through the code and build systems to identify
container images and other components that need to be
ported to arm64 to make this successful.

### Google Coral Edge vs Jetson Nano for edge AI performance

Sam Sterckval has been looking at edge AI performance and is
testing out new platforms to compare against high performance systems.
A few benchmarks compare Google's Coral Edge AI USB device with
the Jetson Nano from Nvidia. One of the best comparisons plugs
the Coral into the Nano to take advantage of fast and inexpensive
USB3 performance.

The benchmarks look at MobileNetV2, Keras, and Tensorflow.
The Jetson Nano demonstrates a 75% power reduction with a 10%
performance boost compared to an old i7-4840HQ (2014 Macbook Pro)
without any change in source code. Even better results come from
the Coral Edge USB stick, but Sam cautions that the slow USB2
performance of the Pi limits its performance when combined
with that platform.

### cuDF, Jetson build attempt

cuDF is a data frame package for the Python
language that takes advantage of accleration with
CUDA GPU cores. Work is underway to document the
build process on the Nvidia Jetson series, but there
are a whole lot of dependencies to work your way through!

cuDF is based on the Apache Arrow project's columnar
memory format, and provides a `pandas` like familiar
API for data scientists. Accelerate your workflows
without going into the details of CUDA coding. It is
part of the RAPIDS suite of open source software for
GPU-accelerated data science and analytics.

### Dieter Reuter series on Docker on Jetson Nano

Dieter Reuter from Hypriot has a new Jetson Nano,
and is going through the process of systematically
documenting its use with Docker.

For Dockercon he has created a Hallway Track session,
title is “Docker for ARM and IOT devices. I’ll show the
brandnew NVIDIA Jetson Nano” on Wednesday, May 1, 2019 at 3:00 pm.
If you are in San Francisco for Dockercon you'll want
to see him there!

### Linux on DeX

Samsung DeX turns flagship Samsung Galaxy smart phones into
portable PCs, allowing them to run a modified Ubuntu 16.04
arm64 version and drive an HDMI screen via USB-C. The reviews
make it clear that this distribution is aimed at developers
and not gamers or browser users. Hardware supported is a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 or better.

### NEMU, a cloud hypervisor based on QEMU

NEMU is a fork of the QEMU hypervisor from Intel. It differs from QEMU in
stripping away legacy components and focusing on the pieces needed to 
run modern cloud workloads. It supports only x86-64 and arm64 guests
through a `virt` virtual machine that doesn't attempt to mimic any
existing hardware.

NEMU is closely tracking QEMU development, with a rebase on QEMU 4.0
in progress. If you're currently using QEMU as a hypervisor but not
going very far beyond a core set of features, NEMU is certainly worth
a look.

### Docker, Arm partner for containers everywhere

Docker and Arm have announced a partnership aimed at delivering
container based workloads everywhere, from cloud-based Arm servers
to embedded Linux systems. Details of the partnership and what it
means for actual Docker product offerings will be announced at 
Dockercon in San Francisco.

### k3os, a Kubernetes operating system

k3os is a minimal operating system designed to be just enough to run
the Rancher k3s Kubernetes distribution. Like other container operating
systems it is notable for its singular purpose and its small attack
surface. One goal of the project is to enable things like operating
system upgrades through the normal Kubernetes processes, rather than
having a separate out-of-band OS management layer.

The project is still in early stages, so if you have input on the
direction you'd like to see it take now is the time to engage. The
promise is that it will support both x86 and Arm systems, though
some of the smallest single-board computers have awkward boot sequences
and kernel dependencies on proprietary software that may limit support.

### Kata Containers CI/CD setup includes Arm testing

Kata Containers is a container runtime for Kubernetes.
It aims to provide process isolation by executing code
in extremely lightweight VM's.

Kata did a writeup of their extensive test and validation
process, which runs across multiple clouds and architectures
to validate and check correct behavior. This includes testing
on every check-in on an arm64 server in the Works on Arm
cluster.

Though Kata has widespread testing of its core components
across multiple platforms, there is still work to be done
on packaging, as it has been noted that there is currently
no binary distribution of Kata for arm64 in the main repo.
This makes installation by end users more of a challenge
than it should be at the moment.
