### Visual Studio Code for Windows 10 on Arm

I'm using the 32-bit x86 Windows build of VS Code, so
it's running emulated on my Windows 10 on Arm laptop.
So far so good, though I'd much prefer a native version.

### Getting started with the Jetson Nano (Hackster)

Alisdair Allan has a long, no-punches-pulled review
of the Jetson Nano, focusing on the new user experience
of setup. Alisdair is a command-line person, and provides
a comprehensive walk-through from unboxing to setup to
running some machine learning examples. He's not fond
of the Tegra's L4T Linux distribution, writing:

> ... that isn’t any excuse for the awful state of their Linux distribution. The amount of pain it caused both during setup and getting things done was excessive. I don’t think I’ve struggled this hard with a Linux distribution to make it do what I want it to do in a good few years.

His recommendation to Nvidia? Make the introductory experience
focus on tools that data scientists are familiar with - Python,
Tensorflow, and Jupyter Notebooks - rather than C++ code examples.
