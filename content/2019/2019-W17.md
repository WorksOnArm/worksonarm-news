### Visual Studio Code for Windows 10 on Arm

I'm using the 32-bit x86 Windows build of VS Code, so
it's running emulated on my Windows 10 on Arm laptop.
So far so good, though I'd much prefer a native version.

The only glitch so far is that it didn't work to create
a terminal window until I followed instructions in a Github
issue to set a flag.

### Getting started with the Jetson Nano (Hackster)

Alisdair Allan has a long, no-punches-pulled review
of the Jetson Nano, focusing on the new user experience
of setup. Alisdair is a command-line person, and provides
a comprehensive walk-through from unboxing to setup to
running some machine learning examples. He's not fond
of the Tegra's L4T Linux distribution, writing:

> ... that isn’t any excuse for the awful state of their Linux distribution. The amount of pain it caused both during setup and getting things done was excessive. I don’t think I’ve struggled this hard with a Linux distribution to make it do what I want it to do in a good few years.

His recommendation to Nvidia? Make the introductory experience
focus on tools that data scientists are familiar with - Python,
Tensorflow, and Jupyter Notebooks - rather than C++ code examples.

### Google Coral Edge vs Jetson Nano for edge AI performance

A few benchmarks compare Google's Coral Edge AI USB device with
the Jetson Nano from Nvidia. One of the best comparisons plugs
the Coral into the Nano to take advantage of fast and inexpensive
USB3 performance.

### cuDF, Jetson build attempt

cuDF is a data frame package for the R statistical
language that takes advantage of accleration with
CUDA GPU cores.

### Dieter Reuter series on Docker on Jetson Nano

Dieter Reuter from Hypriot has a new Jetson Nano,
and is going through the process of systematically
documenting its use with Docker.

For DockerCon I created now a Hallway Track session,
title is “Docker for ARM and IOT devices. I’ll show the
brandnew NVIDIA Jetson Nano” for Wednesday 2pm.
