### Visual Studio Code for Windows 10 on Arm

I'm using the 32-bit x86 Windows build of VS Code, so
it's running emulated on my Windows 10 on Arm laptop.
So far so good, though I'd much prefer a native version.
This whole newsletter was written with VS Code, with
the help of the `vscode-markdownlint` Markdown lint
tool from David Anson.

The only glitch so far is that it didn't work to create
a terminal window until I followed instructions in a Github
issue to set a flag; from then on, no problems.

### Getting started with the Jetson Nano (Hackster)

Alisdair Allan has a long, no-punches-pulled review
of the Jetson Nano, focusing on the new user experience
of setup. Alisdair is a command-line person, and provides
a comprehensive walk-through from unboxing to setup to
running some machine learning examples. He's not fond
of the Tegra's L4T Linux distribution, writing:

> ... that isn’t any excuse for the awful state of their Linux distribution. The amount of pain it caused both during setup and getting things done was excessive. I don’t think I’ve struggled this hard with a Linux distribution to make it do what I want it to do in a good few years.

His recommendation to Nvidia? Make the introductory experience
focus on tools that data scientists are familiar with - Python,
Tensorflow, and Jupyter Notebooks - rather than C++ code examples.

### Panfrost graphics in Linux 5.2 and support for the Rock960

Panfrost is an open source graphics driver for the Bifrost (Mali-G71)
and Midgard (Mali-T600, Mali-T700, and Mali-T800) series of Arm Mali
graphics coprocessors. The new driver has been added to the DRM-Next
train until the Linux 5.2 kernel merge starts in May. It features basic
OpenGL functionality, but no OpenCL or Vulkan API support.

Sahaj Sarup from 96Boards has tested out this driver, using
the 96Boards Rock960 board. He provides detailed installation
directions and a Youtube video as a proof of work during OpenHours episode 142.

### Google Coral Edge vs Jetson Nano for edge AI performance

Sam Sterckval has been looking at edge AI performance and is
testing out new platforms to compare against high performance systems.
A few benchmarks compare Google's Coral Edge AI USB device with
the Jetson Nano from Nvidia. One of the best comparisons plugs
the Coral into the Nano to take advantage of fast and inexpensive
USB3 performance.

The benchmarks look at MobileNetV2, Keras, and Tensorflow.
The Jetson Nano demonstrates a 75% power reduction with a 10%
performance boost compared to an old i7-4840HQ (2014 Macbook Pro)
without any change in source code. Even better results come from
the Coral Edge USB stick, but Sam cautions that the slow USB2
performance of the Pi limits its performance when combined
with that platform.

### cuDF, Jetson build attempt

cuDF is a data frame package for the Python
language that takes advantage of accleration with
CUDA GPU cores. Work is underway to document the
build process on the Nvidia Jetson series, but there
are a whole lot of dependencies to work your way through!

cuDF is based on the Apache Arrow project's columnar
memory format, and provides a `pandas` like familiar
API for data scientists. Accelerate your workflows
without going into the details of CUDA coding. It is
part of the RAPIDS suite of open source software for
GPU-accelerated data science and analytics.

### Dieter Reuter series on Docker on Jetson Nano

Dieter Reuter from Hypriot has a new Jetson Nano,
and is going through the process of systematically
documenting its use with Docker.

For DockerCon he has created a Hallway Track session,
title is “Docker for ARM and IOT devices. I’ll show the
brandnew NVIDIA Jetson Nano” on Wednesday, May 1, 2019 at 2:00 pm.
