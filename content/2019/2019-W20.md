### CNCF CI with Arm support

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) has expanded their
continuous integration and test coverage of several core Kubernetes
components on Arm. The v2.4.0 release of the CNCF CI dashboard
covers testing of Kubernetes, CoreDNS, Fluentd and Prometheus.
Adding test coverage of Envoy is next in the plan.

The implementation team from Vulk Coop will be at Kubecon in
Barcelona and is planning to discuss their findings with interested
parties at that event.

### BeagleBone AI preview

The BeagleBone project has previewed their new "BeagleBone AI",
a small single-board computer with embedded vision engine ("EVE")
cores. The device made its debut at Embedded World in Germany.
It's based on the TI AM57x family of chips, with cape header
compatibility with previous BeagleBone devices. No pricing has
been announced.

### Allwinnner A10/A20 SATA write speed performance

Igor Pecovnik and the Armbian team have come up with changes
to the SATA driver for the Allwinner A10/A20 SoCs that substantially
improves write speed performance. The changes were done by reverse
engineering a poorly documented register set that controls DMA
receive and transmit FIFOs.

A recommendation as with any new change that affects disk I/O is that
correctness is far more important than performance, and so if you
have Banana Pi or Cubieboard systems to spare this would be a good
system to contribute test cycles to before it goes into production.

### Neoverse N1, Wikichip

The Wikichip database has perhaps the best single collection of detailed
information about chip and SoC designs in one place. The system is
maintained by WikiChip LLC, led by technology journalist David Schor.
Coverage includes the latest as well as historical designs, with a goal
to provide representative coverage from the transistor level up to the SoC.

As an example, the new Arm Neoverse N1 design has a detailed page
on Wikichip, with schematic layouts and a comparison with earlier
designs, compiled from news reports and personal communications with Arm.

### Snips open sources Tract, an inference engine for edge devices

Tract is an inference engine for edge devices, written in Rust with
a goal of enabling acceptable performance on CPU and memory
constrained systems. Tract is written in Rust and compares
favorably to Tensorflow Lite and the ARM NN SDK. Using Tract,
you can implement on-device features like "wake word detection"
with a minimum of hardware and no network dependencies.

Snips has open sourced Tract, one piece of their commercial
voice assistance technology, and the code is available on Github.

### Rack mount Pi

If you are looking for a rack mount solution to hold just a few
Raspberry Pi's in a standard 1U form factor, PCSL has an inexpensive
case that allows three of those single-board computers to be
racked. The design exposes the GPIO pins for those systems,
enabling a whole set of options for additional systems integration.

### Alex Ellis update on OpenFaaS

Alex Ellis from the OpenFaaS project has released a project
update for this open source functions-as-a-service platform.
The presentation deck is accompanied by an hour long presentation
and question session, spelling out the project goals for this
"serverless" development enviornment that runs on top of Docker
or Kubernetes.

### NGINX on Amazon EC2 a1.* Arm instances

Amazon and NGINX have partnered to make it easy to deploy this
application load balancer on the Arm-powered Amazon a1.* instance
types.

### Microsoft Build trip report

Last week's Microsoft Build conference featured a Windows Insider
interview with the Windows 10 on ARM team, who have been developing
software and systems support for the set of devices originally referred
to as the ACPC ("Always Connected PC"). Thanks to Jon Kunkee alerting
me to this interview.

### HPE to acquire Cray

HPE has announced plans to acquire Cray for $1.3 Billion. The acquisition
will bring together two of the leading companies in high performance
computing, both of which have used Marvell ThunderX2 chips in their designs.

### Google Pik image format

Google has released a new "Pik" file format, designed
for high performance, efficient image compression.
The software distribution includes SIMD support for
Intel and Arm systems, encapsulated in a set of
libraries that may be suitable for study or other
uses.
