### Allwinnner A10/A20 SATA write speed performance

Igor Pecovnik and the Armbian team have come up with changes
to the SATA driver for the Allwinner A10/A20 SoCs that substantially
improves write speed performance. The changes were done by reverse
engineering a poorly documented register set that controls DMA
receive and transmit FIFOs.

A recommendation as with any new change that affects disk I/O is that
correctness is far more important than performance, and so if you
have Banana Pi or Cubieboard systems to spare this would be a good
system to contribute test cycles to before it goes into production.

### Neoverse N1, Wikichip

The Wikichip database has perhaps the best single collection of detailed
information about chip and SoC designs in one place. The system is
maintained by WikiChip LLC, led by technology journalist David Schor.
Coverage includes the latest as well as historical designs, with a goal
to provide representative coverage from the transistor level up to the SoC.

As an example, the new Arm Neoverse N1 design has a detailed page
on Wikichip, with schematic layouts and a comparison with earlier
designs, compiled from news reports and personal communications with Arm.
