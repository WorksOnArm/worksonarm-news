### Arm announces Cortex-A77 CPU

Arm has announced a new CPU core design, the Cortex-A77. The chip
design features about a 20% performance improvement over their A76
design, and is designed for use in big.LITTLE configurations paired
with the Cortex-A55. Parts built from this design would use a 7nm
process and can be clocked up to 3 Ghz.

### MediaTek to use A77 CPU in newest design

MediaTek has announced their plans to use Arm's new A77 CPU
design in a forthcoming SoC, expected to appear in devices
in 2020. The new and as of yet unnamed part will target 5G
telephony applications, and will incorporate MediaTek's 5G
modem onboard. The single chip design is expected to support
extended battery life compared to the offboard modem designs
that now predominate in the market.

### Debian cross-build quality assurance

Helmut Grohne of the Debian project has added some tooling
to help identify and fix Debian software packages that
have problems building across platforms. The system reports
on builds that fail and provides build logs and links to
project home pages and bug trackers.

### Azure SQL Database Edge

Azure SQL is a new technology from Microsoft that brings
a SQL query engine to the edge of the network. Designed to
run on arm64 and x86 devices, the product will bring a familiar
programming enviornment to developers on edge devices.
Azure SQL Database Edge is currently in private preview.
