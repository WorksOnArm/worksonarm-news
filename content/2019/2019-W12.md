### Nvidia Jetson Nano, $99 AI computer

The Jetson Nano is a $99 development system from Nvidia. It features
4 GB of memory, a quad-core A57 CPU, and most importantly for
the applications envisioned a 128-core Maxwell GPU with software
support for AI and machine learning applications like 
TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe, Keras, and MXNet.

### Nvidia Linux4Tegra (L4T) 32.1

Linux4Tegra (L4T) 32.1 is a Linux distribution for the
Jetson AGX Xavier, Jetson TX2, Jetson TX2i, and Jetson Nano.
It is derived from Ubuntu 18.04, and uses a kernel based on Linux 4.9.
L4T is distributed as part of their Jetpack system, which
also includes software and hardware drivers.

A number of patches for the Tegra line have been
upstreamed to the mainline Linux kernel. Work is 
underway to boot Fedora 30 on these systems.

### Arduino 1.8.9 supports arm64

The Arduino software development kit has been updated in
version 1.8.9 to include support for arm64, with the Raspberry
Pi Model 3 and Nvidia Tegra systems the first targeted 
systems. This SDK enables developers to program their
Arduino and update its software directly from their arm64 device.
