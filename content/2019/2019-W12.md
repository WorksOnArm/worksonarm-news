### Nvidia Jetson Nano, $99 AI computer

The Jetson Nano is a $99 development system from Nvidia. It features
4 GB of memory, a quad-core A57 CPU, and most importantly for
the applications envisioned a 128-core Maxwell GPU with software
support for AI and machine learning applications like 
TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe, Keras, and MXNet.

### Nvidia Linux4Tegra (L4T) 32.1

Linux4Tegra (L4T) 32.1 is a Linux distribution for the
Jetson AGX Xavier, Jetson TX2, Jetson TX2i, and Jetson Nano.
It is derived from Ubuntu 18.04, and uses a kernel based on Linux 4.9.
L4T is distributed as part of their Jetpack system, which
also includes software and hardware drivers.

A number of patches for the Tegra line have been
upstreamed to the mainline Linux kernel. Work is 
underway to boot Fedora 30 on these systems.

### Arduino 1.8.9 supports arm64

The Arduino software development kit has been updated in
version 1.8.9 to include support for arm64, with the Raspberry
Pi Model 3 and Nvidia Tegra systems the first targeted 
systems. This SDK enables developers to program their
Arduino and update its software directly from their arm64 device.

### "Arm on Arm" summit at Linaro Connect

Marvell, Arm, and Linaro are hosting an "Arm on Arm" summit
at the Linaro Connect conference in Bangkok, Thailand. The
goal of the event is to describe how developers can build
and maintain a self-hosted development system for Arm
development completely on Arm devices, without any
need for emulation.

### How usable is desktop Linux on ARM? (Linux Journal)

Bryan Lunduke offers an opinionated viewpoint on the usability
of Linux on the desktop on Arm processors in this Linux Journal
podcast.

### LLVM toolchain 8.0.0 

LLVM version 8.0.0 is out. This compiler family for C and C++
has a set of general improvements in this version across all
architectures, and features new support for aarch64 (arm64)
to mitigate against speculative attacks.

### Using multiple CPU cores with GNU parallel

GNU Parallel is an effective and simple tool for using
multiple cores and executing applications and pipelines
in parallel. It is notably interesting on arm64 systems
due to the relatively high core counts found in these machines.

A tutorial from John Westlund at Xensoft describes how 
GNU Parallel can even speed up single-threaded Linux
commands, if the work those commands tackle can be appropriately
divided up.

### Bootstrapping Windows 10 on arm64 devices

Ben (imbushuo) describes the process of bringing Windows 10 for
Arm onto new devices, including the Nvidia Tegra based Nintendo
Switch. Getting the boot process exactly right is the big
challenge, and he looks specifically at UEFI development.
