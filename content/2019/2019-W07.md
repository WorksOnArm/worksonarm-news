News this week from Phoronix, Techcrunch, Techrader, Liliputing, 
and code on Github and Gitlab. 

### Linux on Arm laptops

Phoronix and Liliputing report on the aarch64-laptops project, which seeks to bring
a full Ubuntu distribution to several Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 based
laptops sold as Windows 10 devices. A Github repository is available
with the code and with images. This is a developer ready project, and
if you've done drivers for things like graphics chips and trackpads
you'll be welcomed here.

### NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier comparison

Phoronix looks at NVIDIA's Jetson AGX Xavier hardware, which 
outstrips the capabilities of most single-board Arm devices
on the market today.

The MNT Reform is an open-hardware Arm laptop powered by an i.MX6,
funded via Crowd Supply. They write:

> Modern laptops have secret schematics, glued-in batteries, and
mystery components all over. But Reform is the opposite â€“ it invites
both curious makers and privacy aware users to take a look under
the hood, customize the documented electronics, and 3D-print their
own parts.

The i.MX6 SoC has 4x 1.2 GHz ARM Cortex-A9, plenty to power a laptop
but not ideal for high performance computing. If you are using 
remote infrastructure for your projects, and if you like to know
exactly how your system runs and how to change or fix it, this may
be the project for you.

### GCC vs LLVM Clang on aarch64

Michael Larabel of Phoronix writes in 
"GCC 8/9 vs. LLVM Clang 7/8 Compiler Performance On AArch64"
about tests done on the relative performance of these two
modern C and C++ compilers. There are enough differences
that neither one stands out as universally better, and 
clearly both compiler suites are continuing to improve.

### Solar powered edge AI

Techcrunch reports on an [xnor.ai](https://www.xnor.ai/) project to
bring AI technologies to very small, solar powered devices at the edge
of the network. The prototype device is the size of a cracker and has
a low resolution camera, a small AI chip for running models, and enough
of a solar cell to harvest energy from the Sun to keep a supercapacitor
charged.

### Windows 10 on your Raspberry Pi

WOA is of course "Works on Arm", but it's also "Windows on Arm", notably
for Windows 10. A team from (XXX) has put together and published a kit
to get Windows 10 on Arm running on your Raspberry Pi 3. It's not exceptionally
fast, but it runs!

### In other newsletters: DevOps'Ish

[devopsish.com is edited on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/chrisshort/devopsish.com). 

Chris Short has an interesting pipeline for working on his newsletter,
which covers the DevOps side of the industry. I follow Chris at least
as much for what he does as how he does it.
