* Multi-architecture Alpine support

### Multi-architecture Alpine support 

As reported in 2017-W41 (two weeks ago), work has been underway to
produce an updated distribution of Alpine Linux, packaged for Docker
in such a way that it can be a base image for many computing architectures.
This work has been completed, and now Alpine containers can support
not just x86 systems but also ARM (32 and 64 bit) and IBM (Z and Power).

With this change, 53 of the top 140 Docker images are now available
for arm64, up from 44 of 140 when the system had last been polled.

Newly supported packages for arm64 images with multi-architecture
support in Docker include:

* alpine: A minimal Docker image based on Alpine Linux with a complete package index and only 5 MB in size!
* docker: Docker in Docker!
* influxdb: InfluxDB is an open source time series database for recording metrics, events, and analytics.
* ghost: Ghost is a free and open source blogging platform written in JavaScript
* nats: NATS is an open-source, high-performance, cloud native messaging system.
* nats-streaming: NATS Streaming is an open-source, high-performance, cloud native messaging streaming system.
* kapacitor: Kapacitor is an open source framework for processing, monitoring, and alerting on time series data.
* bash: Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne Again SHell
* chronograf: Chronograf is a visualization tool for time series data in InfluxDB.

### Docker and databases for arm64

If you're looking to run on official arm64 Docker container
for your MySQL-based database, you'll find that the official
channels don't provide an answer yet. Some sense of state
of the art:

*MySQL* for Docker's open issue, "support arm64 architecture", has
this comment from Joe F (@yosifkit):

> This would need support from MySQL upstream to release packages for
other architectures in their apt repo. (to me, this seems unlikely
since they don't commercially support much more then i386 and amd64:
https://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html )

* https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/issues/318

*MariaDB* is a fork of MySQL from the original maintainers. It too is
x86 only for now in its official version. From Guillaume Lefranc
(@tanji):

> Hi, arm64 support will not happen because MariaDB Foundation
focuses on intel architecture, the choice of building for other
platforms is left to distribution maintainers. You can find arm64
packages in debian for example.

* https://github.com/docker-library/mariadb/issues/125

*Percona* is another commercial source of MySQL. It too is lacking
an arm64 supported version in Docker, with this comment from @yosifkit

> Percona: no open issue yet, but we are limited by percona.com's
apt repo which only has amd64 and i386 binaries

If you are willing to go with a community supported version of MySQL,
there is a solution. The *LinuxServer.io* team has a community version
of MariaDB available as a Docker image for aarch64 (arm64). 
Please review the image carefully before putting it into production!

* https://hub.docker.com/r/lsioarmhf/mariadb-aarch64/

*PostgreSQL* is an alternative to MySQL, though not by any means
a drop-in replacement. It has full multi-architecture support available,
with arm64 versions in the supported Docker installation.

### EdgeX Foundry support by Cavium

EdgeX Foundry is a vendor-neutral open source project building a
common open framework for IoT edge computing.

Over the past few months, Cavium has helped create a strong ARM64-based
version of the EdgeX platform that is on par with the versions for
other CPU platforms.  The focus was on ensuring efficient
execution of the platform on OCTEON TX processors using a intelligent
edge gateway reference design.

For details see this blog post by Gorka Garcia and Federico Claramonte
from Cavium who detail the work they have done to provide software support
for this OCTEON based design:

### Fast integer compression in C using the StreamVByte codec

StreamVByte is a new integer compression technique that applies
SIMD instructions (vectorization) to Google's Group Varint approach.
The net result is faster than other byte-oriented compression
techniques, and the approach is patent-free. The code is available
under the Apache License.

The package is from Daniel Lemire, a computer science professor at
the University of Quebec, with code to speed up these
operations on Arm NEON operations contributed by Kendall Willets.

### Rappel, a Linux-based assembly REPL for x86, amd64, armv7, and armv8

From the project description:

> Rappel is a pretty janky assembly REPL. It works by creating a
shell ELF, starting it under ptrace, then continiously rewriting/running
the .text section, while showing the register states. It's maybe
half done right now, and supports Linux x86, amd64, armv7 (no thumb),
and armv8 at the moment.

If you are learning arm64 assembly langauge, this looks like an
interesting tool to be familiar with. The code is credited to
_yrp (@yrp604).
