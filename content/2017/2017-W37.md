### Works on Arm announcement of partnership with Packet, Arm 

Packet and Arm announced the partnership that brings you this newsletter,
plus a commitment to developer access to Arm platforms for development,
test, and continuous integration.

> Packet, the leading provider of automated bare metal for developers, 
today announced a partnership with Arm to support the rapidly expanding 
ecosystem for the Arm®v8-compatible architecture. Through the partnership, 
Packet will provide free on-demand access to Armv8-A bare metal systems from 
Cavium, Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of 
Qualcomm Incorporated, and others - enabling open source and commercial 
software projects to easily test against a variety of datacenter-grade machines.

Look for more details coming in the next few weeks about how access to these resources.
News coverage of the effort has been generally positive, with Data Center Knowledge
saying this:

>  [D]evelopers often require direct access to physical infrastructure to 
build and deploy next-generation workloads that fully utilize the underlying 
hardware capabilities. This also gives them a way to make sure their software 
works on the most basic ARM installation before tweaking it to work and play 
well with someone else's software. There are other reasons as well, but you get the picture.

### Multi-arch support in Docker Hub

After a multi-year effort to design and implement a system for transparently
supporting multiple architectures, Docker this week released official multi-arch
versions of their most popular images through Docker Hub.

Phil Estes from IBM who has led this effort has a very good writeup of the
journey to this point. In "DockerHub Official Images Go Multi-platform!", he
writes:

> So, every once in awhile you get the immense pleasure of seeing an idea 
through from start to finish. Multi-platform container images may not be 
exciting for everyone, but it’s a topic I’ve been thinking about and working 
on since a team at IBM first approached me about helping figure this out in November 2014.

The end result of this collaboration is the ability for Docker to support a
single unified Dockerfile that will transparently pick up the right architecture
for the machine it's running on, and an ability for package providers to publish
an image that handles multiple architectures at the same time. 

A few details along the way are worth noting. At this instant there's support
for multiple operating system versions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora) but not
yet for Alpine which is still adjusting their build process to produce the right
artifacts. The `containerd` team also had to scramble a bit to patch up some
unforeseen assumptions that are now different.

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 for Arm Beta 

Release notes are available for Red Hat customers for RHEL 7.4 for arm64. 

> Red Hat remains committed to providing 
customer choice when it comes to datacenter infrastructure. Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux 7.4 maintains this commitment with availability across 
multiple architectures, including IBM Power, IBM z Systems and 
64-bit ARM (as a development preview).

### CentOS 7.4 for Arm

In close parallel with the RHEL release, CentOS has announced
the availability of CentOS 7.4.1708 for arm64. The release notes
are brief, with the primary change a move from a 4.5 kernel to
a 4.11 kernel. 

CentOS is also now available in container form through a multiarch
container on Docker Hub. Jim Perrin writes:

> As of today we have official ARM64 support for #CentOS 
containers in the docker-hub. We'll be adding more soon!

### Travel plans

From the editor -

This week has been a busy week with travel to Open Source Summit,
Moby Summit, and Mesoscon, all conveniently located in the same hotel
in Los Angeles. 

In two weeks I'll be at Linaro Connect in San Francisco.

The list of people I've seen on the road is too long to let me make it complete.
Thanks in particular to Elsie Wahlig of Qualcomm, Jeff Underhill of Arm,
my colleague Ben Holton of Packet, Joerg Schad and Judith Malnick of 
Mesosphere, and Laura Fisher.
