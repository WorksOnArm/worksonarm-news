### Linaro Enterprise Reference Platform

From a news release from Linaro:

> The Linaro Enterprise Group has worked closely with Linaro’s Core
Technology & Tools teams to deliver the Linaro Enterprise Reference
Platform with updates across the software stack (Firmware, Linux
Kernel, and key server workloads) for Arm based Enterprise servers,
and with a focus on QA testing and platform interoperability.

> OpenStack reference architecture is now available with ansible
playbooks, allowing users to deploy an end to end Openstack reference
on Arm servers. BigTop 1.2 stack of BigData components have been
built and tested with OpenJDK 8. Bigtop 1.2 consists of Hadoop 2.7.3
(upgraded from 2.7.2), Spark 2.1 (upgraded from 2.0), Hive 1.2.1
and HBase 1.1.3 as core components. In this release all smoke tests
have been verified running on Arm for Hadoop – HDFS, Yarn and
MapReduce, Hive and Spark. ELK v5.4.1 stack of components (ElasticSearch,
Logstash and Kibana) are also built as part of this release.

### Raspbian Stretch for Raspberry Pi

The Raspbian operating system for the Raspberry Pi has been
updated with a new edition based on Debian Stretch (Debian 9).
The capacities and changes to the new system are highlighted
on the official Raspberry Pi weblog. In addition to a whole
set of updates coming from the Debian distribution update, the
project has also update a number of user applications including
Chromium, improved Bluetooth audio support by removing PulseAudio,
and changing handling of the default 'pi' user login.

Raspbian is an operating system that runs on 32-bit ARM based
Raspberry Pi systems. It runs in 32-bit mode even on the Pi 3 Model B,
which is capable of running 64-bit arm64 code. See below if
you are interested in operating system alternatives.

### Fabio Loli's list of Raspberry Pi and ARM64 operating systems

Fabio Loli (@fabiololix) maintains a list of operating systems
known to run on the Raspberry Pi and also on other 32-bit and
64-bit ARM single board computers. The list details contact
information for the release, names who is working on the project,
and notes where relevant if the distribution is derived from
some other set of work.

I was happy to see not only good entries for a number of distributions
that was familiar with, and also news of some systems that were
new to me.

The list is maintained on Github, and pull requests are welcomed.

### Marina.io, a Docker registry for armhf and aarch64 systems

Marina.io is designed as a resource for systems running Docker on
32-bit and 64-bit armhf and aarch64 systems. It provides a registry
for Docker images compiled for those systems, and a Github webhook
for doing automated builds of containers in their Raspberry Pi based
compute farm.

Christoph Witzany and Dražen Lučanin built CloudFleet, a personal
data assistant based on Raspberry Pi hardware, and noted the lack
of universal support for ARM containers in DockerHub. This project
hopes to remedy that gap with easy integration and automated builds.

### DynamoRIO, a runtime code manipulation system

DynamoRIO announces AArch64 support in Release Candidate 1 for
their 7.0 release. 

> DynamoRIO is a runtime code manipulation system that supports
code transformations on any part of a program, while it executes.
DynamoRIO exports an interface for building dynamic tools for a
wide variety of uses: program analysis and understanding, profiling,
instrumentation, optimization, translation, etc. Unlike many dynamic
tool systems, DynamoRIO is not limited to insertion of callouts/trampolines
and allows arbitrary modifications to application instructions via
a powerful IA-32/AMD64/ARM/AArch64 instruction manipulation library.
DynamoRIO provides efficient, transparent, and comprehensive
manipulation of unmodified applications running on stock operating
systems (Windows, Linux, or Android) and commodity IA-32, AMD64,
ARM, and AArch64 hardware. Mac OSX support is in progress."

### CNCF Community Infrastructure Lab

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation has announced a project
to provide free infrastructure - including access to ARM64 servers -
through Packet's bare-metal hosting service.

A $25,000 monthly grant provides access to bare-metal servers for
projects that advance the CNCF's goals. Member organizations and
open source projects can apply for these credits through a Github
based open application process.
