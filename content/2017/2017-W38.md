### Moving the Works on Arm News repository

The plan in progress is to move the repository from the
personal Github account it's on now to a Works on Arm
organizational account, ideally without breaking anything.

### Docker official images are now multi-platform (Docker blog)

From an article on the Docker weblog written by Michael Friis:

> This past week, Docker rolled out a big update to our Official Images 
to make them multi-platform aware. Now, when you run 
`docker run hello-world`, Docker CE and EE will pull and run the 
correct `hello-world` image whether that‚Äôs for x86-64 Linux, 
Windows, ARM, IBM Z mainframes or any other system where Docker 
runs. With Docker rapidly adding support for additional operating 
systems (like Windows) and CPU architectures (like IBM Z) this 
is an important UX improvement.

By using a script provided as a Docker image by Phil Estes of IBM,
`mquery`, I was able to inventory the top 140 "official images" in
the system. Of these, 44 are already available as multi-arch capable
images that support the arm64/linux platform. I'll be keeping track
of that count as time goes forward to assess progress.

### Work in progress: Official multiarch images for Alpine Linux

One of the popular operating system base images for Docker is Alpine Linux,
which provides a very small and functional system to use in base 
containers. Work is in progress to build multiarch Alpine, taking
the work to date that already supports arm64.

From Michael Friis again:

> Because so many of our official images rely on Alpine, we're really 
looking forward to this update. Please let us know if there's any 
help we can offer. @tianon has led the rest of the multi-arch effort 
and would be available to assist if that's useful.

### New Works on Arm website improvements

The Works on Arm website that supports this newsletter has
had a number of improvements released over the past few weeks.
It's now possible to subscribe to a newsfeed of the newsletter,
and entries for many packages have been brought up to date.

We're currently tracking 32 different software packages,
operating system distributions, and programming languages
that offer support for arm64 in some fashion. You know and
I know that that number is really much larger, but also that
some systems have work left to be done to get first-class
support for Arm. One of the goals in coming months is to 
expand out coverage of the ecosystem and validate and
verify more major components.

Does your favorite _ work on Arm? Look for the logo, and if
you don't see it, drop me a note to explore and update.

### Call for proposals for Works on Arm infrastructure access

As part of the support for Works on Arm announced by Arm
last week, we are taking proposals for projects that are
looking for support for test, validation, and especially
CI/CD on arm64. 

Please see the issues list in the Works on Arm cluster
repository for details. This week's proposals include

* Container Linux components (etcd, mantle, rkt) (Geoff Levand)
* Docker official container builds (Tianon Gravi)
* Kubernetes end-to-end testing (Lucas K√§ldstr√∂m)
* OCaml build and CI (Anil Madhavapeddy)
* OpenJDK Java builds from Adopt OpenJDK (Tim Ellison, George Adams, IBM UK)

Looking forward to seeing your proposal!

### Report from Open Source Summit

Three days in Los Angeles for Open Source Summit North America.
Aaron Welch, Ben Holton, and Ed Vielmetti (your editor) were there
for Packet. I spent my time bouncing back and forth between the
Packet booth and the Arm booth at the show. 

We had a Qualcomm Centriq 2400 server main board at the
booth, and greeted a long list of show attendees who were
interested in Packet's bare metal server offerings.

### Report from Moby Summit

Full day in Los Angeles for Docker's Moby Summit. Good discussion
included reports on Linuxkit booting on arm64 as well as the
announcement (above) on multi-architecture support for containers
in Docker Hub. I was in for the morning and lunch part of the series,
then off to Mesoscon.

### Report from Mesoscon

Two full days in Los Angeles for Mesoscon. Showed off the Qualcomm
Centriq 2400 board, and talked to a number of folks who were
interested in tackling completion of the port of Mesos to Arm.
I gave a talk late in the day Friday on our efforts,
‚ÄúOne Ring to Bind Them‚Äù - Packet, Qualcomm, & Mesos: A Window into the Development of the Armv8 Ecosystem.

Slides for the talk are available.

### Next week: Linaro Connect

Ed Vielmetti and Aaron Welch of Packet will be at Linaro Connect 
in San Francisco. Aaron is keynoting on Wednesday, and we'll be
there for Arm Data Center Day. Hope to see you there.
