## Conference reports

Red Hat Summit in Boston on May 2-4, 2017 featured the ARM Pavillion.
Vendors [Cavium], [Qualcomm], [Packet], [Linaro], [Phoenics Electronics] and [Gigabyte]
were in attendance alongside ARM. I was on the show floor for three days,
talking to people from a variety of industries and from [Red Hat].

[Serverless] was in Austin Texas in late April 2017.
This [account from Adobe I/O] describes some highlights
from the event, including the history and evolution of
computing and a description of the "toddler years" of
serverless efforts.

## Upcoming events

Mityltics will be at Apache Big Data 2017, May 16-18 in Miami, 
with Manish Singh presenting on 
[Cassandra on ARMv8 - A Comparison with x86 and Other Processor Platforms](https://apachebigdata2017.sched.com/event/9zsr/cassandra-on-armv8-a-comparison-with-x86-and-other-processor-platforms-manish-singh-mitylytics).

The [call for proposals deadline for ARM TechCon](http://www.armtechcon.com/arm-techcon-2017-call-for-proposals-now-open/) is May 19,
for an event to be held October 24-26 in Santa Clara, CA.

## Single board computers: the Hikey 960

The Hikey 960 is designed as a single board computer for Android development.
It was developed by Huawei and can be purchased through a variety of distributors
listed at the [96boards web site]. US suggested retail price is $239.
The system has an 8-core Huawei Kirin 960 processor, featuring
4 ARM Cortex A73 and 4 Cortex A53 cores, 3GB of DRAM, and 32G of flash.

## 64 bit operating systems for the Raspberry Pi 3

Raspberry Pi 3 owners have several choices for booting an ARMv8-based 64-bit
operating system on that system.

[SUSE Linux] was announced for Raspberry Pi 3 systems in November
2016. The release announcement notes that it is based on the upstream
kernel used for SLES for ARM and has a common code base with all
architecture supported by SUSE Linux Enterprise. Based on this
support, StackIQ announced a version of their [Stacki] data center
provisioning software that works with the Raspberry Pi to let you
build ARM and Intel based clusters.

Hypriot is a distribution based on Debian 8. Dieter Reuter
put together a workshop on building a full arm64 distribution
for the Pi 3, complete with build scripts for all aspects of
the system, in his [Building a 64bit Docker OS for RPi3].

## ARMv8 servers by the hour from Scaleway and Packet

[Scaleway] announced the availability of virutalized ARMv8 systems
on April 27, 2017 out of their Paris data center, with availability
in Amsterdam scheduled soon. Systems are available with 2, 4 or 8
cores, and cost upwards from 2.99 Euros/month.

[Packet]'s Type 2A server, a 96-core Cavium based ARMv8 system, was featured
at the ARM Pavillion at Red Hat Summit. Priced at $0.50/hr, it provides
developers with easy access to hardware for their ARMv8 development,
as well as infrastructure for workloads. (Packet is a sponsor of this newsletter).

## Work in progress

Highlighting work in progress where a modest amount of 
incremental effort is likely to result in software that 
works on ARM. Each of these projects is available for
you to contribute to.

[CockroachDB] is a distributed database designed as an 
open source equivalent to Google's Spanner database,
for disaster-tolerant global infrastructure.  Work is in progress to
[port this system to ARMv8].

## Web infrastructure

[Nginx] is a web server, reverse proxy server, load balancer and
HTTP cache. Since 2014 it has been commercially supported on ARMv8.

[Nginx]:http://www.nginx.com

[Hugo] is a static site generator used for weblogs and web site development,
and since v0.20.3 the official release includes ARMv8 support.

## ARM Assembly speedups

[WolfSSL] (formerly CyaSSL) has ARMv8 native instruction support
to speed up SSL termination. The software is widely used in 
embedded systems, and also includes server support for integration
with [Nginx].

## Continuous integration

Several open source projects at Packet are using Jenkins
for continuous integration and remote builds. If your project
currently builds on ARM - or if you'd like it to - contact
ed@packet.net to discuss your build needs.

## In other newsletters

[Cloud Native Monthly], April 2017, was produced by the Cloud
Native Computing Foundation. You'll need to subscribe to get a
copy - a sample February newsletter is online.

Sysdig's [Containers News] No. 5 for March and April 2017 has
a good roundup of container-based computing news.

## Portability notes

If you're writing code for ARMv8, you'll want to 
be aware of these issues that require special attention.

CockroachDB discovered that the Go 1.8.1 runtime returns
slightly different numeric results for floating point
operations, characterized generally as different rounding
behavior for the very last decimal place.
Other anomalous results have been seen in 
PHP and in the JVM based Clojure language. Work is underway
to provide minimum test cases to ARM and to language developers
and to identify guidance for acceptance tests.

## Colophon

Produced in part on the show floor at Red Hat Summit.
