# Works on ARM news, Issue 1, April 28, 2017

This is the first edition of Works on ARM news, a newsletter
from [Ed Vielmetti], Special Projects Director at Packet that covers development of
software for ARMv8 in open source and the enterprise.

## Infrastructure automation

Docker's "moby" project has support for booting LinuxKit kernels
on Packet's Intel and ARM based infrastructure.

[Ansible] has released documentation for its [support of Packet].
This code was written by [Tomáš Karásek].

## Work in progress

Highlighting work in progress where a modest amount of 
incremental effort is likely to result in software that 
works on ARM. Each of these projects is available for
you to contribute to.

Alex Ellis presented FAAS, 
[Functions as a service],
at DockerCon in Austin on April 20, 2017.
His twelve minute demo won best of show for "cool hacks",
demonstrating scaling up "serverless" computing using Docker Swarm.
See his [repo on Github] for
code. There's a bit of work left to port to arm64, mostly having to do with
getting Docker up and running on the box in an automated way with a minimum of fuss.
Alex is interested in contributions from the community, and notes that FaaS
brings portability to serverless functions.

## Languages and compilers

[NodeSource] [announced ARMv8 support for Node.JS] on March 31, 2017.
The official build for node.js for linux/arm64 is done on
a Packet [Type 2A] 96-core server, and is released at the same time
as all other binaries for supported platforms. Node.JS is
a popular language for Internet development because it allows
developers access to the same Javascript language that is
in the browser to also power back end services.

[Go 1.8.1] was released on April 7, 2017. This is primarily a
bug fix release, and it addresses a number of small issues
on a variety of platforms. See the [Go release history] for details.
Go 1.8.1 is avaiable on Ubuntu through the [Go 1.X Packages PPA],
and can be built from source on Ubuntu using the system Go
which is 1.6.4 as a bootstrap. See [worksonarm.com/golang]
for a full account.

The [Adopt OpenJDK project] is using infrastructure at Packet for
continuous integration in 
building this open source Java runtime. They are working on a release for arm64,
though it is not ready yet as of April 26, 2017.

## ARM Assembly speedups

[Minio] has developed [sha256-simd], a package of Go code
that's a drop-in replacement for the Go system SHA256 crypto
routines. Minio's version is accelerated with assembly language
code for ARM and Intel processors. These measured speed
improvements range from 10x to 100x depending on the situation.

## Continuous integration

Several open source projects at Packet are using Jenkins
for continuous integration and remote builds. If your project
currently builds on ARM - or if you'd like it to - contact
ed@packet.net to discuss your build needs.

## Bug fix releases

[Minio], a storage system that provides an S3 compatible
interface to your data, sent out news on April 25 announcing
a bug fix release with [critical fixes] that have security implications.

## Portability notes

If you're writing code for ARMv8, you'll want to 
be aware of these issues that require special attention.

When the Go syscall interface was frozen, ARMv8 systems did
not support a dup2() system call. For portability, you'll
want to do as the CockroachDB team did and wrap those calls
with conditional compiles to pick up dup3() instead. It turns
out this is also necessary for Windows portability and log file
handling. See [PR 14441 for CockroachDB] for details on implementing
a portable "dupFD" interface.

[PR 14441 for CockroachDB]:https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14441

Different ARMv8 systems implement different system page sizes.
Your code should determine the system page size at runtime, with
a goal of being portable enough so that if it's built on a system
with 4K pages that it will run on a system with 64K pages. Versions
of Go 1.7 and earlier have a [bug in fetching the system page size],
a problem that's addressed in the Go 1.8 series. This issue is
also being [addressed by the .NET Core CLR team].

[bug in fetching the system page size]:https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10180
[addressed by the .NET Core CLR team]:https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/9517

The contents of the `/proc/cpuinfo` file system differ between
ARM and Intel systems. If you are parsing that file to determine
the number of cores on the machine, you may get incorrect results
if you have not made that code more portable. In particular,
[this Juju bug], "manual: detection of cores fails on Packet Type 2A",
resulted in [Juju] (Canonical's open source application modeling tool) finding only one core
on Packet's 96-core Type 2A system. The bug was fixed by Witold Krecicki
for Juju 2.2 beta 3.
