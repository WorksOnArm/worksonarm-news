# Works on ARM news, Issue 4, Friday May 19, 2017 (Week 20)

This is the fourth edition of Works on ARM news, a newsletter
from [Ed Vielmetti], Special Projects Director at Packet that covers development of
software for ARMv8 in open source and the enterprise.

[Ed Vielmetti]:https://www.packet.net/about/ed-vielmetti/

In this issue: 
developer resources from ARM,
HPE's "The Machine", 
a NAS Kickstarter from Helios,
the controversy over systemd that launched Devuan, 
OpenJDK builds from AdoptOpenJDK, 
Go 1.9 speedups in the queue,
and more.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for Issue 5, please 
send them to ed@packet.net or contact me on the Packet community Slack
channel as "ed.packet". Tweets can be send to the @[worksonarm] account
or to @[vielmetti].

## ARM Infrastructure Developer Community portal

[ARM Infrastructure Developer Community portal]:https://developer.arm.com/markets/infrastructure/arm-infrastructure-developer-community/developer-resources

The [ARM Infrastructure Developer Community portal] is a central
showcase and global directory for developers seeking to harness the
innovation available within the ARM ecosystem for next generation
data center, cloud and network infrastructure deployments.
Hosted by ARM, it provides a solutions library for use cases,
developer resources for hardware and software needs, and 
an introduction to partners in the ARM ecosystem.

A number of newsletters are available from ARM through
this project; most interesting of which to me is the
"Linux and Open Source Development Newsletter".

## HPE "The Machine" ThunderX2 based multi-terabyte main memory machine

[Venturebeat]:https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/16/hp-enterprise-unveils-single-memory-160-terabyte-computer-the-machine/
[HPE web site]:https://news.hpe.com/content-hub/memory-driven-computing/
[PC World]:http://www.pcworld.com/article/3197054/hardware/hpe-shows-off-the-machine-prototype-without-memistors.html

HPE has unveiled a design for a high performance, large memory
system based on the Cavium ThunderX2 ARM chipset. "The Machine",
as it is dubbed, would have the ability to address 160 terabytes
of memory over a 40-node cluster with 1280 Cavium ARM cores. A
high speed switching fabric dubbed "Gen-Z" connects the kit together.
The prototype was demoed in a lab in Fort Collins, Colorado, says
Agam Shah in a story in [PC World].

"The Machine" represents the latest push from HPE that they label
"Memory-Driven Computing", looking at the set of problems
that can be addressed with very large main memory systems.
The challenge for the industry will be the expense of 
building multi-terabyte scale memory compute nodes and the
knowledge necessary to program these systems effectively.

## ARM NAS Kickstarter from Helios

[Helios 4]:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/helios4/helios4-personal-cloud-the-worlds-1st-open-source?ref=woa4

Helios has announced a Kickstarter campaign to fund development
of a "personal cloud" device. The [Helios 4] would support four
SATA 3.0 hard drives as well as gigabit ethernet using a Marvell Armada 388
chip at its core. 

The device ships with [Armbian] (a version of Debian Linux) as its
operating system, and with NAS software from [OpenMediaVault]
and [Syncloud] to fill out the home data sharing user experience.

[Armbian]:https://www.armbian.com/
[OpenMediaVault]:http://www.openmediavault.org/
[Syncloud]:http://syncloud.org/

As of this writing the Helios team is about a third of the 
way towards their fundraising goal. For about US$175 one can
make a preorder for the 2 GB version of this machine, which is scheduled for
availability in the September 2017 timeframe. Note that the price as delivered
includes a case but not the hard drives you would need, and
some assembly will be required.

Please also note on the Kickstarter that prices are listed
in Singapore dollars.

## Adopt OpenJDK: open source Java build system

[Adopt OpenJDK]:https://adoptopenjdk.net/

[Adopt OpenJDK] is in the early stages of putting together a build
farm for OpenJDK releases for this open source Java implementation.
At the moment the project has the most
complete single source for OpenJDK binaries across multiple platforms,
with ARM, Power, Z series, Intel, Mac, and Windows builds in progress.

"The AdoptOpenJDK Build Farm is still a Work In Progress. Please DO
NOT use downloaded binaries for your production purposes."

[Packet] is a sponsor of Adopt OpenJDK.

## Go 1.9 speedups in CRC32 codes

[CRC32 code]:https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20370

Speedups of up to 7x in [CRC32 code] when
using the IEEE and Castagnoli polynomials 
are planned for the Go 1.9 release 
thanks to contributions
by ARM's Fangming Fang. This 32-bit cyclic redundancy check
is widely used to detect errors in network and file systems.

The need for a performant CRC32 code was noted in the process
of getting [CockroachDB] to pass all of its build tests on arm64.
[Very slow write performance] was noted on a database function
that performs acceptably on x86. Make a note to retest this
function after Go 1.9 appears, likely to be in late July 2017.

## FreeBSD quarterly report

[FreeBSD quarterly report]:https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2017-01-2017-03.html
[Marvell Armada38x]:http://www.marvell.com/embedded-processors/armada-38x/

The [FreeBSD quarterly report] is out for the first quarter of
2017, detailing progress and tasks ahead for this BSD variant.

Cavium's ThunderX is the initial reference target platform for FreeBSD/arm64.
The supported platform supports a single 48-core model in FreeBSD 11.0,
but the 96-core dual chip version is not yet supported and 
thus not yet available at Packet.

Final testing and productionization of support for the 
[Marvell Armada38x] ARMv7 platform is under way. 
The rebase and cleanup is going
well, with patches functioning on top of HEAD and ready for
upstreaming.

## Devuan, a systemd free Debian distribution

[Devuan]:https://devuan.org
[Devuan 1.0 RC2]:https://devuan.org/os/debian-fork/stable-2nd-candidate-announce-050517

[Devuan] is a fork of the successful Debian project with a singular
mission to remove all system dependencies on the "systemd" init 
system. Systemd replaces older BSD and Linux init systems, acting
as PID 1 in a running system. The systemd project has expanded towards
other essential Linux system core functions including name and time
service to name only two. The Devuan maintainers (and some
others) have taken up the cause of removing systemd from their
world as a struggle for freedom.

In [Devuan 1.0 RC2], Devuan has support for 29 different ARM boards including the
Acer Chromebook and the Raspberry Pi model 3 in 64-bit mode.

Read more about the Devuan project in [The Register].
