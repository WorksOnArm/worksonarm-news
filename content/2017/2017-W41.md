### Balena, a new container runtime from Resin.io

Balena is a new container runtime from Resin.io. It's based
on Docker's Moby, and has a number of new features that
make it a good choice for embedded systems containers.
These include support for container deltas resulting
in up to 70x bandwidth efficiency on updates, atomic
image pulling to avoid problems with glitches during
updates, and support for low-memory operations.

Balena is missing some features (notably Docker Swarm
compatibility) but is otherwise a drop-in replacement
for Docker on armv5, armv6, armv7, aarch64, i386, and x86_64
systems. Note that there is no Balena for Windows or Mac.

Balena is available as a source tree from Github, and
there's a simple installer for it as well. The folks at
Arch Linux were quick to package it for use by that distribution.

### Red Hat Software Collections language update

Red Hat has updated its Software Collections (RHSCL) with new
versions of several popular development languages,
including Python, PHP, Node.js, and more.  
Red Hat Software Collections 3.0 Beta also adds new
support for three new architectures: s390x, aarch64, and ppc64le.

### Puppet partnership with Arm for arm64 agent

Puppet is a software automation system used to 
manage infrastructure.
 
> Collaboration with Arm: Arm® technology is at the heart of a computing
and connectivity revolution that is transforming the way people
live and businesses operate. Arm technology is enabling intelligence
in over 100 billion devices today and securely powering products
from the sensor to the smartphone to the supercomputer. In collaboration
with Arm, later this year Puppet will release and support a new
agent to manage infrastructure built on the 64-bit Arm architecture.

### 6Wind and DPDK on Arm for NFV

SANTA CLARA, Calif., and PARIS, Oct. 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 6WIND,
a high-performance networking software company, today announced
6WIND software support for Arm processors. For over a decade, 6WIND's
6WINDGate™ packet processing software helps customers build high
performance networking products on x86 and MIPS architectures and
this same support will be generally available for Arm architectures
in Q1 2018. With today's announcement, OEMs and Network Builders
can choose the best architecture from the industry's leading
processors to meet the requirements for new generation networking
designs such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Telco Clouds
and Data Center Consolidation.

## Issues not yet resolved

### Caution for cross-built Docker images

Under certain (all?) circumstances, cross building a Docker image on one
architecture for another results in an image that's labelled for
the wrong architecture. This impacts using this image on Swarm
where it may fail to load without much explanation.

### Java on QEMU 2.8 or later

Some but not all versions of QEMU have limitations on
running Java applications in emulation. While this was
noticed on an aarch64 guest on an x64 system, the problem
is not specific to Arm, and affects recent versions of QEMU.

A workaround is to run the Java application on a single
CPU with --cpuset-cpus="0"
or to force interpreter-only mode with `-Xint`.

### Multi-architecture Alpine support in progress

Multi-architecture support in official Docker images for
the popular Alpine operating system is in progress.
A number of issues are queued up behind this. New
Alpine support will also enable a number of multi-architecture
packages in Docker, so we're all looking forward to this
being resolved.
