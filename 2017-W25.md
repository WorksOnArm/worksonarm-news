### Port: Elasticsearch to ARM

[Elastic] is working on a port to [Elasticsearch] to ARM.
Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine with a REST API.
[Drew Raines] is leading up the effort, which is
nearing the point where the test suite completes without
error. Drew writes:

[Elastic]:https://www.elastic.co/
[Elasticsearch]:https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch
[Drew Raines]:https://github.com/drewr

> These commits produce a working Elasticsearch binary and get the
full test suite to pass. It has not been tested in any production
capacity. 

https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/25318

### Call to action: Test Go 1.9 Beta 1; Go floating point.

Go 1.9 Beta 1 is in a test phase. If your project requires
Go, please put together a simple test plan that includes 
the Go 1.9 Beta 1 binary release. Feedback of any sort,
including benchmarks, build tests, or especially documentation,
are all welcomed.

https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19082

One open issue that will not be addressed in Go 1.9, however, is
discrepancies in the math libraries that result in exp(1) giving
different results depending on what hardware you are using.  In
issue golang/go 20319 the analysis is that some platforms use
assembly language and others use Go do to floating point.  "amd64
and s390x have assembly implementations, all the others architectures
use a pure go routine and they implement different algorithms, so
last-bit-mismatches are not unexpected."

https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20319

The Go (golang) page on Works on ARM has been updated with
the latest information; see http://worksonarm.com/golang for more
details.

### Call to action: Test Rust 1.18 on ARM!

"Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast,
prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety."

Rust 1.18 has been released; the release notes suggest
performance improvements in the compiler.

https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/06/08/Rust-1.18.html

See http://worksonarm.com/rust for more details.

### Hardware: Cavium ThunderX2 

[Cavium] has a series of announcements about their new [ThunderX2]
hardware. The Cavium news release gives brief details of partnerships
with 
Altair (graphics rendering with Thea Render),
AMI (UEFI),
ARM,
Bright Computing,
Bull,
Canonical (Ubuntu),
Linaro (development cloud),
Numerical Algorithms Group,
Red Hat,
Rogue Wave (debugging),
and SUSE,
plus mention of hosted options at
Packet and Scaleway.

### Hardware: Qualcomm Centriq 2400

Packet is showcasing Qualcomm's new Centriq 2400 at 
developer conferences and providing attendees access to a number
of demos that use open source tools such as Ansible, Terraform,
Docker and Kubernetes. These demos of Qualcomm
Datacenter Technologies’ ARM architecture-based servers 
are at Red Hat’s [AnsibleFest] conference in London, and also
be present at [Hashiconf] in Austin, the [Open Source Summit North America] 
in Los Angeles, and [AnsibleFest] in San Francisco.

### Events: Frankfurt HPC conference

Frankfurt was the center of the high performance
computing world this week, with ISC's HPC conference
winding up on Thursday.

http://isc-hpc.com/

The GoingARM account live-tweeted the ARM
portion of the HPC conference which featured several 
standing-room only sessions about ARM for HPC and
a Thursday workshop.

### Distro: Fedora 26 Beta

Fedora announced Fedora 26 Beta, which has support for ARM.  "A
Beta release is code-complete and bears a very strong resemblance
to the third and final release. The final release of Fedora 26 is
expected in July."

https://arm.fedoraproject.org/
https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-the-release-of-fedora-26-beta/

See http://worksonarm.com/fedora for more details.

### Distro: Debian 9 LTS

Debian released Debian 9 "Stretch" for ARM on June 17.
This is an LTS release.

https://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/2017/msg00003.html

> A total of ten architectures are supported: 64-bit PC / Intel
EM64T / x86-64 (amd64), 32-bit PC / Intel IA-32 (i386), 64-bit
little-endian Motorola/IBM PowerPC (ppc64el), 64-bit IBM S/390
(s390x), for ARM, armel and armhf for older and more recent 32-bit
hardware, plus arm64 for the 64-bit "AArch64" architecture, and for
MIPS, in addition to the two 32- bit mips (big-endian) and mipsel
(little-endian), there is a new mips64el architecture for 64-bit
little-endian hardware. Support for 32- bit Motorola/IBM PowerPC
(powerpc) has been removed in "Stretch".

See http://worksonarm.com/debian for more details.

### Distro: Alpine 3.6.2

Alpine released an Alpine 3.6.2 point release on June 17, 2017.
This is a bug fix release, and includes additional drivers
enabled for some Mellanox ethernet cards.

https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.6.2-released.html

See http://worksonarm.com/alpine-linux for more details.

### CI: Gitlab CI Omnibus for ARM

An open issue in the continuous integration world is how
best and easiest to run on ARM. One aspect of this is Gitlab,
and there's an open issue in the Omnibus Gitlab project
for how to get your Gitlab CI completely self-hosted on ARM.

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/1625

See http://worksonarm.com/gitlab for more details.

### QCloud Hosted ARM in China

New to the ARM hosting world, QCloud (Tencent Cloud) has a service
黑石 (translated here as Blackstone) for hosted ARM servers. Devices
are available for monthly or yearly reservations. All of the available
documentation on the service is for the China market.

https://www.qcloud.com/product/arm

A rough translation:

> Blackstone ARM Server (CPM for ARM) is a bare metal rental service
for ARM servers. The Blackstone ARM example uses the ARMv8 architecture,
which provides greater memory capacity and more physical cores,
with more performance and more competitive TCO (total cost of
ownership); and naturally compatible mobile applications, no need
for Instruction set translation. If your business is high concurrent
or mobile scene, Blackstone ARM server will be a very wise choice.
