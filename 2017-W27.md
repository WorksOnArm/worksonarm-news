### Momentum is Building for ARM in HPC

"Momentum is Building for ARM in HPC" is an article
in The Next Platform
by Jonathan Beard and Roxana Rusitoru
of ARM Holdings
chronicling the GoingARM workshop at the recent ISC conference
on high-performance computing
in Frankfurt, Germany.
 
https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/06/30/momentum-building-arm-hpc/

> From looking around the room, it was clear the workshop was
significantly more popular than expected. During the entire day,
there was standing room only, having throughout the day approximately
70 attendees. In spite of the crowded room, the audience stuck it
out to hear from early users of SVE simulators (University of
Michigan), application and runtime porters (BSC, AVL), ARM library
and Allinea tool designers, RIKEN, Cavium and the lead on the
Isambard project (University of Bristol).

The article was subsequently picked up by Hacker News, with
a measure of interesting discussion.

### Kubernetes 1.7 release

Kubernetes announced a 1.7 release on Thursday, June 29, 2017.
The release notes speak of security hardening, a mechanism for
handling embedded secrets, and a set of improvements related
to making stateful updates.

http://blog.kubernetes.io/2017/06/kubernetes-1.7-security-hardening-stateful-application-extensibility-updates.html

Kubernetes 1.7 ships with native ARM64 support for client,
server, and node binaries, making 64-bit ARM a first-class
platform for developers.

### Xen 4.9 release

[Xen] is a hypervisor. The project releases Xen 4.9
on 28th of June, 2017. The release notes are extensive,
and include a whole set of ARM improvements. Among those
include this:

> Alternative runtime patching and GICv3 support for ARM32: Alternative
runtime patching which enables the hypervisor to apply workarounds
for erratas affecting the processor and to apply optimizations
specific to a CPU and GICv3 support was extended for 32-bit ARM
platforms, bringing this functionality to embedded use-cases.

> System Error Detection (ARM): Xen on ARM made a step forward in
reliability and serviceability with the introduction of System Error
detection and reporting, a key feature for customers with highly
available systems.

### Docker for Raspbian (ARMv6) for v17.07

In the Github repository docker/docker-ce-packaging issue 11, Stefan
Scherer writes:

> This PR adds build steps to create DEB packages for Raspbian and for all Raspberry Pi models including the ARMv6 Pi Zero, Pi Zero W or old Raspberry Pi (1) model A/B.

> I'm now running 17.07.0-dev on my Raspberry Pi Zero W.

> I kept the names of the Dockerfiles at Dockerfile.armv7l so someone can build them on eg. Scaleway servers.

Docker support for the smallest and oldest Raspberry Pi models 
requires ARMv6 support; this support had been dropped in Docker 17.06-ce,
as Docker went through a series of reconfigurations with their
"moby" and "Linuxkit" projects. This PR is community provided,
and not merged into Docker mainline code or packaging.

### Apache Mesos on ARM

Yuqi Gu & Yibo Cai of ARM gave a presentation on 
"Running Marathon/Mesos on ARM Server" at MesosCon
Asia in Beijing on June 22, 2017.

> Marathon/Mesos has been well adopted and deployed, in X86
architecture servers. How about running Marathon/Mesos in ARM server?
Fortunately, we proved that only small effort is required to port
Marathon/Mesos onto ARM AArch64 servers. There are a few small traps
and tricks, but the overall porting is straightforward. We would
like to present running Marathon/Mesos in ARM servers to manage a
cluster on top of which some applications can be deployed and scaled
in containers.

The [Mesos on ARM presentation slides] describe the work necessary
for the port at slide 6, where the authors point out the Mesos
includes vendor dependencies for protobuf, Zookeeper, libev,
and Leveldb, each of which has no AArch64 support in their old
versions but when brought forward to current versions handle
AArch64 properly. In addition there is a dependency on Google's
"glog" logging library that had to be addressed.

The authors report that Mesos master and slave nodes
work properly once these changes have been made, and
from that point forward cluster operations are as normal.

### Armbian Linux for development boards

[Armbian Linux] is a Debian derivative with support for a number
of ARM based development boards. Led by Igor Pečovnik of
Ljubljana, Slovenia, this project uses an 
"advanced but easy to use" x86 based toolchain
to make boot image from sources for a wide
range of supported boards:

> Beelink X2, Orange Pi PC plus, Orange Pi Plus 2E, Orange Pi Lite,
Roseapple Pi, NanoPi M1, pcDuino2, pcDuino3, Odroid C0/C1/C1+,
Banana Pi M2+, Hummingboard 2, Odroid C2, Orange Pi 2, Orange Pi
One, Orange Pi PC, Orange Pi Plus 1 & 2, Clearfog, Lemaker Guitar,
Odroid XU4, Udoo Neo, Banana Pi M2, Orange Pi A31S, Cubieboard 1,
Cubieboard 2, Hummingboard, Lamobo R1, Banana Pi PRO, Orange Pi
mini A20, Olimex Lime A10, Olimex Micro, Olimex Lime 2, pcDuino3
nano, Banana Pi Plus A20, Udoo quad, Orange Pi A20, Olimex Lime 1,
Banana Pi, Cubox-i, Cubietruck

Recent work has focused on both legacy kernels which tend to
offer more device support including video and display features,
as well as mainline kernels with support primarily for headless
server operations.
