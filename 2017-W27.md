### Momentum is Building for ARM in HPC

"Momentum is Building for ARM in HPC" is an article
in The Next Platform
by Jonathan Beard and Roxana Rusitoru
of ARM Holdings
chronicling the GoingARM workshop at the recent ISC conference
on high-performance computing
in Frankfurt, Germany.

> From looking around the room, it was clear the workshop was
significantly more popular than expected. During the entire day,
there was standing room only, having throughout the day approximately
70 attendees. In spite of the crowded room, the audience stuck it
out to hear from early users of SVE simulators (University of
Michigan), application and runtime porters (BSC, AVL), ARM library
and Allinea tool designers, RIKEN, Cavium and the lead on the
Isambard project (University of Bristol).

The article was subsequently picked up by Hacker News, with
a measure of interesting discussion.

Kubernetes 1.7 ships with native ARM64 support for client,
server, and node binaries, making 64-bit ARM a first-class
platform for developers.

### Xen 4.9 release
