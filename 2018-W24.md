### EdgeX on Arm

> EdgeX Foundry is a vendor-neutral open source project hosted by The Linux Foundation building a common 
open framework for IoT edge computing.  At the heart of the project is an interoperability framework 
hosted within a full hardware- and OS-agnostic reference software platform to enable an ecosystem 
of plug-and-play components that unifies the marketplace and accelerates the deployment of IoT solutions.

### Building an Arm emulator in Rust

Victor Koenders is building an Arm emulator in the Rust language. Discussion
of this project referenced version 8.2 of the ARMv8-A processor specification in machine readable form.
Alastair Reid from Arm writes about the details of what
is in these specifications and how to use the data in his blog.

### Oracle Linux for Arm 7.5

Oracle Linux images are provided as a development preview for the ARM architecture. Included in the 7.5 development preview is a preview of Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 5, based on the upstream 4.14 kernel.  

The images target the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, Cavium ThunderX2, and
Ampere eMAG processors.

### Libre Computer interview with charbax

Libre Computer has announced three systems which are in the same
form factor as the Raspberry Pi. Le Potato is based on the Amlogic
S905X SoC and supports 2 GB of memory; Renegade is a 4-core Rockchip
RK3328 SoC design with up to 4 GB of memory; and Tritium is based
on several Allwinner designs which have the active Cedrus project
to upstream video decode Linux support underway by Bootlin.

Charbax has a detailed report on these systems, with video from Shenzhen.

### OpenSUSE Leap 15 for 32-bit and 64-bit Arm systems

OpenSUSE Leap 15 is now available for both 32-bit and 64-bit Arm systems.
Leap 15 shares a common core codebase with SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) 15 sources,
enabling developers a path towards enterprise support.

The openSUSE Project supports both the 32-bit ARMv7 architecture and the 64-bit Armv8 ("arm64" or "aarch64") systems. 
The target systems include Raspberry Pi 3, Pine64, ThunderX, APM Mustang, AMD Seattle, and HP Moonshot m400 on the AArch64 architecture, 
and Cubie Board, Cubie Board 2, Cubietruck, Arndale Board, Banana Pi, BeagleBoard-xM, CuBox, BeagleBone, BeagleBone Black, and Calxeda Highbank on the ARMv7 architecture.

### jp

jp is a tool for making dead simple terminal plots from JSON (or CSV) data. 
Bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, histograms and heatmaps are supported. 

Binaries for jp are provided for popular systems including linux/arm64.

### picocluster build

Dr. Jens-Henrik Soeldner is working on a build of a Picocluster,
using 5 Raspberry Pi 3 nodes. He is looking to deploy this as
a "desktop datacenter" with Docker and Kubernetes.

The Pico 5 design also supports using the ODroid C2, ODroid XU4,
and Rock64 single-board computers. A larger PicoCenter 48 scales
up to 48 systems in a single chassis.p

### OpenJDK Arm port consolidation

The teams working on OpenJDK for arm64 have up to this date
maintained two separate efforts, one derived from work done
at Oracle and a second led by Red Hat. The development mailing
list has a recommendation from Bob Vandette at Oracle to 
consolidate on the latter effort.

> The community at large (especially RedHat, BellSoft, Linaro and Cavium)
have done a great job of enhancing and keeping the AArch64 port up to
date with current and new Hotspot features.  As a result, I propose that
we standardize the 64-bit ARM implementation on this port.

### Circumference C25 Raspberry Pi cluster build

Gareth Halfacree is setting up Docker Swarm on a Circumference C25,
a cluster design that incorporates 8 Raspberry Pi systems. He
writes: "It remains a lovely, lovely thing."

> Circumference is built around the popular Raspberry Pi and UDOO 
x86 platforms, with a highly integrated custom backplane for power 
distribution, instrumentation, control and network management, 
and a custom front panel for status indication.

### IC Nexus SBC3100 Rockchip RK3399 SBC Supports Variable DC Input

Taiwan based IC Nexus showcased their SBC3100 board at Computex 2018.
It uses a Rockchip RK3399 SoC, and is notable for its wide range
of input peripherals and for its integrated voltage controller that
allows it to operate in a wide 9-36V DC input voltage range.
