## Upcoming talks

### Usenix SRECon Asia

We are looking forward to the Usenix SREcon Asia presentation "Call
to ARMs: Adopting an arm64 Server into x86 Infrastructure".  Ignat
Korchagin (@secumod) of Cloudflare will describe "an overview of
potential steps and pitfalls of adopting a second CPU architecture
in your cloud".

Usenix SREcon 18 Asia is in Singapore, June 6–8, 2018.

## Kubernetes and Containers

### Kontena Pharos

Kontena Pharos is a "simple, solid, certified Kubernetes distribution"
for public cloud, private cloud, on-premises, bare metal or hybrid.
It is open source under Apache 2 license and free for any purpose: personal or commercial.
Commerical subscriptions are also available.

Pharos was released in April 2018 with full support at launch for arm64 systems,
based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

### Installing Docker on arm64 (Containerstack)

Containerstack has a brief tutorial on installing Docker on 
64-bit Arm servers. The tutorial is brief because Docker
on arm64 is fully on par with other hardware when it comes
to ease of installation.

## Arm Servers

### ThunderX2 talk by Surya Hotha (SC17)

Surya Hotha, Director, Product Marketing at Cavium, talks Innovative
Alternate Architecture for Exascale Computing at the SC17 Supercomputing
ARM HPC User Group event in Denver.

## Arm Desktops

### Socionext Synquacer unboxing (Linaro Connect)

At Linaro Connect in Hong Kong, the 96Boards project
recorded the unboxing and setup of a Socionext Synquacer server.
This 24-core system is designed to be a developer desktop
machine for aarch64 developers. The video is about nine
minutes long.

## Arm Clusters

### Picocluster build

The Picocluster is a ready-to-build kit for putting
together your own Kubernetes cluster. Chaim Krause (tinjaw)
compares this prepackaged kit to a completely do-it-yourself
approach and concludes that the design is money and time well spent.

### Mininodes cluster of Compute Modules (David Tischler, Mininodes)

Arm's Community Innovation blog interviews David Tischler
of Mininodes about his new design for a cluster of
compute modules designed for high density Arm desktop clusters.

> The new miniNodes Cluster Board consists of 5 Raspberry Pi CoM slots
to hold the Pi Compute Modules, with a gigabit Ethernet switch built
right in, all conveniently laid out on a small PCB with a single
power input and Ethernet port. This design will certainly save space
and cabling mess but will also allow us to build automation into
our sales and provisioning process.

### Cryptanalysis on an arm64 cluster

In his paper "Energy-Efficient ARM64 Cluster with Cryptanalytic
Applications: 80 Cores That Do Not Cost You an ARM and a Leg", Dutch
researcher Thom Wiggers from the Institute of Computing and Information
Science, Radboud University, The Netherlands investigates cryptographic
algorithms that work across a cluster of Arm single-board computers.
These algorithms (source code provided) take advantage of the Arm
SIMD instruction set to yield relatively power-efficient computing
for this problem set.  The paper was presented at Latincrypt 2017.

## Operating Systems

### SLES for industrial use

The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) targets a range of tasks,
from enterprise-scale Arm servers to Internet of Things devices
and the "shop floor computer". The SLES for ARM 12 SP3 has the
latest fixes and enhancements for industrial uses.

### Microsoft Build conference, Seattle, May 7-8 2018.

The Microsoft Build developer conference will be held in Seattle on May 7-9, 2018.
Presentations on the topic of 64-bit Arm builds for Windows 10 on Arm are anticipated.

## Networking

### Building a router out of an espressobin

Tyler Langlois builds an Internet router out of an ESPRESSObin
$50 single-board computer, using Arch Linux for Arm, Shorewall,
and dnsmasq to provide solid routing functionality. The build
notes (complete with a custom 3-d printed case) also add
Netflow montoring and traffic shaping to provide a complete solution.
