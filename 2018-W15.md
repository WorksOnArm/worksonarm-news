### Mininodes cluster of Pi 3 Compute Modules

Mininodes interview


David: The new miniNodes Cluster Board consists of 5 Raspberry Pi CoM slots to hold the Pi Compute Modules, with a gigabit Ethernet switch built right in, all conveniently laid out on a small PCB with a single power input and Ethernet port. This design will certainly save space and cabling mess but will also allow us to build automation into our sales and provisioning process.
