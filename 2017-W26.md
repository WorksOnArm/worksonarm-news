### ARM HPC Users Group

The ARM HPC Users Group is providing "resources for end-users and developers deploying on ARM hardware"
for high performance computing. It was organized from a successful workshop at the ISC conference in Frankfurt
in June 2017. 

### Ask Ubuntu: Running 32-bit ARM on 64-bit systems

Ask Ubuntu has a question on running 32-bit ARM codes on 64-bit systems.
While most cell phone derived ARM SoCs support a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit
operations, the data center grade platform from Cavium available at Packet
and Scaleway is a 64-bit only system.

### SUSE Linux \(SLES\) on ARM

(Name) is product manager for SUSE Linux Enterprise System (SLES) on ARM.

### 24-core Socionext server

At the Taipei trade show (name), (name) from Socionext shared information
of Socionext's 24-core ARM SoC, the (part number). It features high efficiency
(A5x) cores and 1 gigabit networking speeds. The show floor interview,
done by (name), demonstrates a cluster running Ubuntu on a number of these
systems.

### EFI and U-Boot on Dragonboard 410c

After some firmware hacking, (name) has gotten EFI and U-Boot to work on 
the Dragonboard 410c, a (speeds and feeds) machine. He refers to the 
sometimes sorry state of ARM firmware on development boards - where every
device needs a new boot loader - as the result of work by "crack addled
firmware engineers". 

### Gitlab Omnibus edition via elraro, ready for testing

As mentioned in WOA 9, Gitlab is a source code hosting tool available in
open source form to be self-hosted. elraro has done the work to port
the Gitlab Omnibus Edition to ARMv8 and has produced a build script
and binary release based on Gitlab 9.x.x. The major compatibility issue
identified is the need to run a current ncurses 6.0 as the older 5.9 release
does not have ARM support.

### Linuxkit on ARM 

Linuxkit is a unikernel based operating system construction kit that
came out of work on Docker to rearchitect their system to make it more
flexible and component driven. Richard Mortier (mort) has done the first
step to port Linuxkit to ARMv8, running on bare metal Packet hardware.

### Ubuntu Core on Raspberry Pi 3 compute module

Canonical has announced that Ubuntu Core is now available for the
Raspberry Pi 3 compute module. This compact computer is the size of
an SO-DIMM memory module, and is designed to be used in embedded systems.

### Go 1.9 Beta 2

Following close on the heels of last week's Go 1.9 announcement is
an update that Go 1.9 Beta 2 is available.
