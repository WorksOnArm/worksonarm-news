### Interview: Jim Perrin on CentOS on ARM

Jim Perrin is interviewed by Jake Edge for [LWN.net](http://lwn.net). 

> Perrin is currently with Red Hat and is the maintainer of the CentOS 64-bit ARM (aarch64) build. CentOS is his full-time job; he works on building the community around CentOS as well as on some of the engineering that goes into it. 

The interview goes into detail of the history of CentOS
on ARM, starting with 32-bit ARMv6 and ARMv7 builds on 
embedded systems and continuing to this on high performance
computing gear.

### ARM HPC Users Group

The ARM HPC Users Group is providing "resources for end-users and developers deploying on ARM hardware"
for high performance computing. It was organized from a successful workshop at the ISC conference in Frankfurt
in June 2017. There is an [ARM HPC Gitlab system] set up for collaboration, an [ARM HPC mailing list] and Slack channel available.

Presentations given in Frankfurt are available at
the [GoingARM.com] web site.

### Ask Ubuntu: Running 32-bit ARM on 64-bit systems

Ask Ubuntu has a question on running 32-bit ARM codes on 64-bit systems.
While most cell phone derived ARM SoCs support a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit
operations, the data center grade platform based on Cavium's ThunderX available at Packet
and Scaleway is a 64-bit only system.

### SUSE Linux \(SLES\) on ARM

Jay Kruemcke is product manager for SUSE Linux Enterprise System (SLES) on ARM.
He writes to share that he has a blog, https://krumemcke.com , which has news
which includes SUSE on ARM information. Follow Jay on on Twitter: [@mr_sles](https://twitter.com/mr_sles).

The Works on ARM website that I edit has updated its information about SUSE Linux
on ARM, and you'll find those details at http://worksonarm.com/suse .

### 24-core Socionext server

At the Taipei trade show (name), (name) from Socionext shared information
of Socionext's 24-core ARM SoC, the (part number). It features high efficiency
(A5x) cores and 1 gigabit networking speeds. The show floor interview,
done by (name), demonstrates a cluster running Ubuntu on a number of these
systems.

### EFI and U-Boot on Dragonboard 410c

After some firmware hacking, (name) has gotten EFI and U-Boot to work on 
the Dragonboard 410c, a (speeds and feeds) machine. He refers to the 
sometimes sorry state of ARM firmware on development boards - where every
device needs a new boot loader - as the result of work by "crack addled
firmware engineers".

### Gitlab Omnibus edition via elraro, ready for testing

As mentioned in WOA 9, Gitlab is a source code hosting tool available in
open source form to be self-hosted. elraro has done the work to port
the Gitlab Omnibus Edition to ARMv8 and has produced a build script
and binary release based on Gitlab 9.x.x. The major compatibility issue
identified is the need to run a current ncurses 6.0 as the older 5.9 release
does not have ARM support.

### Linuxkit on ARM 

Linuxkit is a unikernel based operating system construction kit that
came out of work on Docker to rearchitect their system to make it more
flexible and component driven. Richard Mortier (mort) has done the first
step to port Linuxkit to ARMv8, running on bare metal Packet hardware.

### Ubuntu Core on Raspberry Pi 3 compute module

Canonical has announced that Ubuntu Core is now available for the
Raspberry Pi 3 compute module. This compact computer is the size of
an SO-DIMM memory module, and is designed to be used in embedded systems.

### Go 1.9 Beta 2

Following close on the heels of last week's Go 1.9 announcement is
an update that Go 1.9 Beta 2 is available.
