### Interview: Jim Perrin on CentOS on ARM

Jim Perrin is interviewed by Jake Edge for [LWN.net](http://lwn.net). 

> Perrin is currently with Red Hat and is the maintainer of the CentOS 64-bit ARM (aarch64) build. CentOS is his full-time job; he works on building the community around CentOS as well as on some of the engineering that goes into it. 

The interview goes into detail of the history of CentOS
on ARM, starting with 32-bit ARMv6 and ARMv7 builds on 
embedded systems and continuing to this on high performance
computing gear.

### ARM HPC Users Group

The ARM HPC Users Group is providing "resources for end-users and developers deploying on ARM hardware"
for high performance computing. It was organized from a successful workshop at the ISC conference in Frankfurt
in June 2017. There is an [ARM HPC Gitlab system] set up for collaboration, an [ARM HPC mailing list] and Slack channel available.

Presentations given in Frankfurt are available at
the [GoingARM.com] web site.

### Ask Ubuntu: Running 32-bit ARM on 64-bit systems

[Ask Ubuntu] has a question on running 32-bit ARM codes on 64-bit systems.
While most cell phone derived ARM SoCs support a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit
operations, the data center grade platform based on Cavium's ThunderX available at Packet
and Scaleway is a 64-bit only system.

### SUSE Linux \(SLES\) on ARM

Jay Kruemcke is product manager for SUSE Linux Enterprise System (SLES) on ARM.
He writes to share that he has a blog, https://krumemcke.com , which has news
which includes SUSE on ARM information. Follow Jay on on Twitter: [@mr_sles](https://twitter.com/mr_sles).

The Works on ARM website that I edit has updated its information about SUSE Linux
on ARM, and you'll find those details at http://worksonarm.com/suse .

### 24-core Socionext server

At the Taipei trade show Computex, [Socionext] shared information
of their  24-core ARM SoC, the [SynQuacer SC2A11]. It features high efficiency
A53 cores and 1 gigabit networking speeds. The show floor interview,
done by Charbax (Nicolas Charbonnier) of [ArmDevices.net], demonstrates a cluster running Ubuntu on a number of these
systems.

> [ARMdevices.net] is a blog focused on making original video and news contents about ARM Powered devices, mostly from trade shows and conferences around the world. Nicolas Charbonnier, also known as Charbax, has posted all the videos on this site.

### EFI and U-Boot on Dragonboard 410c

After some firmware hacking, [Rob Clark] of Red Hat has gotten EFI and U-Boot to work on 
the [Dragonboard 410c], a development board based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 410E processor. He refers to the 
sometimes sorry state of ARM firmware on development boards - where every
device needs a new boot loader

> Anyone who has dealt with arm (non-server) devices, should be familiar with the silly-embedded-nonsense-hacks world.  In particular the non-standard boot-chain which makes it difficult for distro's to support the plethora of arm boards (let alone phones/tablets/etc) out there without per-board support.  Which was fine in the early days, but N boards times M distro's, it really doesn't scale.

### Gitlab Omnibus edition via elraro, ready for testing

As mentioned in WOA 9, [Gitlab] is a source code hosting tool available in
open source form to be self-hosted. [elraro] has done the work to port
the [Gitlab Omnibus Edition] to ARMv8 and has produced a build script
and binary release based on Gitlab 9.3-stable. The major compatibility issue
identified is the need to run a current ncurses 6.0 as the older 5.9 release
has some issues with ARM support.

### Linuxkit on ARM 

[Linuxkit] is a unikernel style operating system construction kit that
came out of work on Docker to rearchitect their system to make it more
flexible and component driven. [Richard Mortier] (mort) has done the first
step to port Linuxkit to ARMv8, running on bare metal Packet hardware.

### Ubuntu Core on Raspberry Pi 3 compute module

Canonical has announced that Ubuntu Core is now available for the
Raspberry Pi 3 compute module. This compact computer is the size of
an SO-DIMM memory module, and is designed to be used in embedded systems.

### Go 1.9 Beta 2

Following close on the heels of last week's Go 1.9 announcement is
an update that Go 1.9 Beta 2 is available.

As always, your bug reports and success reports with
this beta test are particularly welcome.
