### CES: NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier 

Self-driving cars require lots of computing power to
integrate information coming from high speed sensors
plus deep learning for feature recognition. NVIDIA
announced the "DRIVE Xavier" system-on-chip to power
their latest self-driving platform, built around an 8-core
64-bit custom Arm CPU. NVIDIA writes:

> It’s built around a custom 8-core CPU, a new 512-core Volta GPU,
a new deep learning accelerator, new computer vision accelerators
and new 8K HDR video processors. And with our unified architecture,
all previous NVIDIA DRIVE software development carries over and
runs.

NVIDIA has developer kits available for sale - the Jetson TX1 and TX2 -
which are from a previous generation of CPU designs. As far as
I've been able to determine the new custom Arm SoCs are not
yet available in development kit designs.

### CES: Psion remake, Planet Computers "Gemini"

The 1990s saw the temporary popularity of computing devices
from Psion, which offered a clamshell design with a small full
keyboard hinged to a modest sized screen. The clamshell approach
is enough smaller than a laptop that you can put it in your pocket,
but with a large enough keyboard to not need an on-screen keyboard
for your typing. At CES in Las Vegas, there is an attempt to revive
this form factor from Planet Computers.

It's a tricky combo to get right, and the original Psion designers
are back at it with the "Gemini", a hinged system with a 1080p screen
and compact keyboard. Originally funded via Indiegogo, this device
runs on a 10-core MediaTek Helio X27 processor with 4GB of ram and 
two USB-C ports. The promise is that when it ships it will run some
flavor of Linux to go along with the stock Android release, but no
distribution support details are forthcoming yet.

The BBC has a video interview with designer Martin Riddiford
who walks us through the intended use of the system, both as
a phone for taking and making calls and as a little Android
laptop. 

The Indiegogo offering raised $1.4 million, and at CES the
product won "Slashgear Editor’s Choice Best of CES 2018 award".

Availability of the system is unclear from any of the media reports.
