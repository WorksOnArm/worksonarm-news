### CES: NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier 

> It’s built around a custom 8-core CPU, a new 512-core Volta GPU,
a new deep learning accelerator, new computer vision accelerators
and new 8K HDR video processors. And with our unified architecture,
all previous NVIDIA DRIVE software development carries over and
runs.

### CES: Psion remake, Planet Computers "Gemini"

> The Gemini is a clamshell Android device with an 18:9 ultrawide 1080p screen and a compact but more-or-less full physical keyboard. It runs on a 10-core MediaTek Helio X27 processor and has 4GB of RAM, a 4,220mAh battery, and two USB-C ports. It’s 15.1mm thick when closed and weighs 308g. There are both Wi-Fi-only and LTE-capable models. The software is pretty much stock Android with a useful customized dock that can be brought up anywhere, and you can also dual-boot into Linux for more customization.
