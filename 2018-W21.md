### Isambard HPC Arm comparative benchmarks (CUG 2018)

The Isambard project released new performance results for Cavium
ThunderX2 CPUs using dual-socket B0 silicon and comparing against
Gold & Platinum SKU Skylakes. Simon McIntosh-Smith is Professor of
High Performance Computing, Head of the HPC Research Group, University
of Bristol.

> Results focused on the HPC codes that are most heavily used on
the UKâ€™s national supercomputer, Archer, and showed that for these
kinds of workloads, ThunderX2 is competitive with the best x86 CPUs
available today, but with a significant cost advantage.

HPC-Optimised Arm Processors on Isambard. S. McIntosh-Smith, J.

### Wireguard VPN

Wireguard is virtual private network software with a novel
design that puts most of the work into the Linux kernel.
It makes use of familiar Unix networking primitives to
control routing and filtering of packets, allowing the
system manager to compose a VPN out of components that can
each independently be audited for correctness.

The Wireguard VPN works out-of-the-box with no
changes or adaptations needed on Arm systems; this
was tested on a Raspberry Pi running Hypriot, as
well as on a 64-bit Cavium ThunderX running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
at Packet. The software has been optimized for Arm
processors for about a year now.

The project just announced that its VPN tools would be
available for Macintosh and for Android systems.

### Sprint free data offer for Snapdragon Always Connected Windows 10 PCs 

Sprint is offering 6 months of free data to users
of Snapdragon Always Connected Windows 10 PCs.

> The fine print on the deal notes that the free data excludes
taxes, fees, and surcharges, meaning you will end up actually paying
something. After 12/31/2018, you will be hit for $15 per month after
a $5 per month autopay discount. You must be willing to sign up for
autopay to take advantage of the free unlimited data offer. Obviously,
you do need to own one of these devices with a compatible with the
Sprint network SIM, or purchase one from Sprint or other retailer.

The ASUS NovaGo, HP Envy X2, and the Lenovo Miix 630 are
all eligible for the offer.

### "Better than a Raspberry Pi" list (Carl Perry)

Carl Perry writes on his "Gig of Ham" weblog about a series
of single-board computers that could potentially be considered
"better than a Raspberry Pi". His criteria include more 
system memory, better power distribution than MicroUSB, and
native Ethernet support. The newest Pi 3B+ tops out at
1 GB of RAM, 2.5A@5VDC, and USB based Ethernet. 

One of the big motivations for a "better than" comparison
is the need for small systems with more RAM. In a cluster 
configuration it's all too often that the various Kubernetes
components use up most of 1 GB all by themselves, leaving
just a sliver of memory left for actual applications.

### Rock64 mini-cluster

Martin Alex Smith updates the progress of the Rock64 mini-cluster
first noted here in 2018-W18. The 16-node system will be used for real-time
nanopore genome sequencing analysis. The Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics
is in Sydney, Australia.

> Minimap2 and Nanopolish #methylation detection up and running on
static data; Comparative benchmark vs #HPC server in progress; Eager
to hear name suggestions.

Minimap2 works with ARM CPUs supporting the NEON instruction sets.

Nanopolish is a package for signal-level analysis of Oxford Nanopore
sequencing data.

### FriendlyElec NanoPC-T4 

The NanoPC-T4 from FriendlyElec is a Rockchip RK3399 based system
with an introductory price of $129 for a 4 GB RAM, 16 GB eMMC system
with native gigabit Ethernet and powered by a 12V input at 2A DC
barrel jack. The 10 layer circuit board is a mere 100x64 mm in size.
