### Isambard HPC Arm comparative benchmarks (CUG 2018)

The Isambard project released new performance results for Cavium
ThunderX2 CPUs using dual-socket B0 silicon and comparing against
Gold & Platinum SKU Skylakes. Simon McIntosh-Smith is Professor of
High Performance Computing, Head of the HPC Research Group, University
of Bristol.

> Results focused on the HPC codes that are most heavily used on
the UKâ€™s national supercomputer, Archer, and showed that for these
kinds of workloads, ThunderX2 is competitive with the best x86 CPUs
available today, but with a significant cost advantage.

### Wireguard VPN

Wireguard is virtual private network software with a novel
design that puts most of the work into the Linux kernel.
It makes use of familiar Unix networking primitives to
control routing and filtering of packets, allowing the
system manager to compose a VPN out of components that can
each independently be audited for correctness.

The Wireguard VPN works out-of-the-box with no
changes or adaptations needed on Arm systems; this
was tested on a Raspberry Pi running Hypriot, as
well as on a 64-bit Cavium ThunderX running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
at Packet. The software has been optimized for Arm
processors for about a year now.

The project just announced that its VPN tools would be
available for Macintosh and for Android systems.
