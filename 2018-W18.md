### Conference season is upon us

Spring has sprung, and that means conferences. 
With conferences comes demo-driven development -
people showing off proofs of concept, reports of
early work, and sometimes even full product launch
releases. 

There are brief reports here from Kubecon (Copenhagen),
Red Hat Summit (San Francisco), and Devoxx UK (London),
plus plans for OpenStack Summit (Vancouver).
If you are planning to attend an event please let us
know so it can go on a calendar.

### Kubecon / Cloud Native Con in Copenhagen

Kubecon is winding down after a week of taking over
Copenhagen. This huge conference had over 4000 attendees
dealing in the latest in cloud native technologies.

I had the pleasure of "visiting" Kubecon using the #k8sbot
telepresence robot, a sort of remote controlled video
conferencing system on a stick with wheels. In my brief
visit I saw the Packet booth, and talked to my editor
Zoe Allen there. In my journeys through the show floor I 
also saw someone from Cloudflare's San Francisco office
and we spoke about their efforts on Arm servers.

The most interesting technology to emerge from Kubecon
this year is Google's "gVisor", a user-space container
runtime sandbox designed to be lighter weight than virtual
machines but offering more isolation than containers. 
Written in Go, it should be portable, and would be
an excellent project for someone to try on arm64.
You'll need the "Bazel" build system from Google too.

### Red Hat Summit in San Francisco

Packet and Works on Arm will be in the Arm Pavillion at
Red Hat Summit in San Francisco next week. I'll be there
representing Packet along with Carl Perry and Jacob Smith.
Carl promises he'll bring an armful of Arm powered gear
for the booth.

### Adopt OpenJDK at Devoxx UK in London

George Adams from the Adopt OpenJDK project will be talking
about the Adopt OpenJDK build farm at Devoxx UK in London
next week. We are in the midst of spinning up an OpenStack
cluster for Adopt through Works on Arm, and some details
on that will be forthcoming there.

### Open Stack Summit in Vancouver

John Studarus will be at Open Stack Summit in Vancouver, BC giving
a talk on "Three ARMed OpenStack - Building and Performance Testing
OpenStack on ARM".

> Using the stock OpenStack source and the installation instructions
available on OpenStack.org, we built a Terraform configuration to
deploy and performance test different hardware systems. This included
ARM systems from Cavium, Huawei, and Qualcomm. As a baseline, a
multi-node Xeon system built using the same Terraform configurations
was performance tested.

### Rock64 cluster for genome sequencing, Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics

Our lead photo for the week is a Rock64 cluster that Martin
A. Smith of the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics is putting
together for genome sequencing. This 16-node, 64-core cluster
will be analyzing FAST5 files and has just started its work.

> This will speed up our genome sequencing data analysis at a fraction of the price.

### Exascale computing on Arm (Jack Dongarra)

A report out of the CCGrid18 conference in Washington, DC shares a
slide from Prof. Jack Dongarra which looks at plans for exascale
computing. Arm-based supercomputers are in the works from projects
in China, Japan, Europe and the United States.

### Deploying multiple Traefik Ingresses with LetsEncrypt HTTPS certificates on Kubernetes

Carlos Eduardo has another in his series of tutorials on Kubernetes
running on Arm clusters. In this one, Traefik and MetalLB are used
a part of a load balancing design for ingress controllers.

### GCC 8.1 released

> Are you tired of your existing compilers?
> Want fresh new language features and better optimizations?
> Make your day with the new GCC 8.1!

> This release is a major release, containing new features (as well as many other improvements) relative to GCC 7.x.

The AArch64 target now supports the Scalable Vector Extension, which
features vectors with runtime determined number of elements. It also
includes a set of features for Armv8.2 and Armv8.3 architectures,
and new optimiations for A55 and A75 cores.
