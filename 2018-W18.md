### Conference season is upon us

Spring has sprung, and that means conferences. 

### Kubecon / Cloud Native Con in Copenhagen

I had the pleasure of "visiting" Kubecon using the #k8sbot
telepresence robot.

### Red Hat Summit in San Francisco

Packet and Works on Arm will be in the Arm Pavillion at
Red Hat Summit in San Francisco next week.

### Devoxx UK in London

George Adams from the Adopt OpenJDK project will be talking
about the Adopt OpenJDK build farm at Devoxx UK in London
next week. We are in the midst of spinning up an OpenStack
cluster for Adopt through Works on Arm, and some details
on that will be forthcoming there.

### Rock64 cluster for genome sequencing, Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics

Our lead photo for the week is a Rock64 cluster that Martin
A. Smith of the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics is putting
together for genome sequencing. This 16-node, 64-core cluster
will be analyzing FAST5 files and has just started its work.

### Exascale computing on Arm (Jack Dongarra)

A report out of the CCGrid18 shares a slide from Prof. Jack Dongarra
which looks at plans for exascale computing.
