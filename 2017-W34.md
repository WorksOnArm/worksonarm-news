### Qualcomm Centriq 2400 architecture, first view

Qualcomm has released more information about their Centriq 2400
architecture to the public via a presentation at the Hot Chips
conference. The electronics technology press has run a series
of stories linked below about what's new and notable in these
announcements.

> Falkor is the custom CPU design at the heart of the Qualcomm
Centriq 2400 SoC, the world’s first 10nm server processor, which
will begin shipping commercially later this year.

The press release and presentations focus on several features of
the Centriq 2400. The system is a pure 64-bit ARMv8 compliant
architecture, with no 32-bit cores in the design, and draws from
Qualcomm's history of developing power-efficient custom mobile
processors. The 48-core design uses 24 pairs of custom Falkor
CPUs which share an L2 cache and bus interconnect to the high
speed Qualcomm System Bus (QSB). Power efficiency is engineered
into the hardware, with fast recovery from sleep for idle cores.

Falkor supports cryptographic instructions in the ARMv8 instruction set
for performance when running networking security protocols
such as https. The system is delivered on a fully-integrated SoC
with a high-bandwidth, low latency ring interconnect to a L3 cache.

Much more information is in the press kit and in the detailed
walk-through published by Anandtech. Expect more announcements before
the launch. Ian Cutress has a particularly detailed 7-part analysis
published on Anandtech, which is a good read.

### Edge Computing (Wired)

In "It's time to think beyond cloud computing", Jeremy Hsu writes
for Wired Magazine's "Backchannel" column about how computing workloads
will migrate to the edge of the network and away from monolithic
centralized data centers. He quotes Packet's CEO Zac Smith: 

> It’s a foregone conclusion that giant, centralized server farms
that take up 19 city blocks of power are just not going to work
everywhere.

Packet has just announced an expansion to six additional US data
centers and five additional international data centers.
Also mentioned in the article is Austin-based Vapor IO's buildout
of micro data centers in cell tower infrastructure.

The interesting point mentioned here is that the Internet did not
always have centralized data centers in its architecture. Peter
Levine's presentation on "The End of Cloud Computing" from 
Andreessen Horowitz in 2016 notes that there are cycles in computing
between centralized and decentralized, and that demands from latency-sensitive
applications (like real-time information for self-driving cars)
will push more compute away from centralized data farms into 
distributed systems.

No doubt that power-efficient ARM-based designs will find new uses
and new users at the edge of the network.

### Your Serverless Raspberry Pi cluster with Docker (Alex Ellis)

Alex Ellis has a fine writeup on the hardware behid a "serverless"
architecture on the ARMv7 based Raspberry Pi and his OpenFaaS
functions-as-a-service architecture. He notes:

> This blog post will show you how to create your own Serverless
Raspberry Pi cluster with Docker and the OpenFaaS framework. People
often ask me what they should do with their cluster and this
application is perfect for the credit-card sized device - want more
compute power? Scale by adding more RPis.

Alex writes that "serverless" is a metaphor for this computing
style, where instead of building out a system out of virtual
machines, you reduce the workload to the exercise of individual
functions.

### Towards deploying decommissioned mobile devices as cheap energy-efficient compute nodes 

Shahrad & Wentzlaff at HotCloud’17 have a presentation and paper
on using old mobile phones as energy-efficient compute nodes. They
point out that innovation in the cell phone market has led to 
ever more efficient and powerful devices even at the low end, and
that clever power and housing designs could readily allow a lab
environment to build a highly capable system out of Android-powered
cell devices racked into a 2U chassis and powered and networked
using USB.

Adrian Colyer writes of this work:

> I have one simple rule when it comes to selecting papers for The
Morning Paper: I only cover papers that I like and find interesting.
There are some papers though, that manage to generate in me a genuine
feeling of excitement, as in “this is so cool, I can’t wait to share
it.” This is one of those papers!

### ODroid HC-1 Home Cloud (ARMv7)

ODroid and Hardkernel have announced a new ODroid HC-1 "Home Cloud"
ARMv7 32-bit device which is specifically designed for attaching to
an SSD or HDD for network-attached storage. The device design is
a cost reduction and simplification of the ODroid XU-4, based on
the Samsung Exynos 5422 octa-core Cortex-A15/A7 processor. The 
nice industrial design features an aluminum case that doubles as
a heat sink for the SoC and is easily stackable.
