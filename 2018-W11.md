### Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+

The Raspberry Pi Foundation has announced a new Raspberry Pi
model. The Model 3 B+ has a new 1.4GHz 64-bit quad-core CPU, with
dual-band 802.11ac wireless LAN, a faster Ethernet offering, and
optional Power-over-Ethernet.  If you're not using PoE, a 2.5A
micro USB power supply is required.

The improvements of the Pi 3 B+ over the Pi 3 B are incremental,
and should be welcomed by both industrial and hobbyist users of
the device. The numbering suggests that this is not a redesigned
"Pi 4", but rather a series of smaller changes that get a few
more years of life out of the design.

The system is backwards compatible with previous Pi designs,
with one small change. The Power over Ethernet header, a new
four-pin connector, is tall enough that it might require changes
to case designs and some HATs that will not have enough 
clearance for the new pins.

### Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+: 1.4 Ghz 64-bit quad-core CPU

A Broadcom BCM2837B0, Cortex-A53 (ARMv8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.4GHz is
at the heart of the new Model 3 B+. The main changes in this
new chip over the older BCM2837 have to do with heat dissipation
and power management. The new chip comes in a metal container
with a built-in heat spreader, allowing for more stability under
high loads before thermal throttling sets in.

One consideration for the new design is that it is more power-hungry
than previous versions, requiring a 2.5A 5V power supply or the
new as-yet unreleased PoE HAT.

### Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+: Faster Ethernet, faster Wifi

The new Pi 3 B+ comes with two new networking chips. The
wired networking is upgraded to a Microchip LAN7515 USB 2.0
to Gigabit Ethernet bridge, and the new wireless chip is
based on a Cypress CYW43455 module with BLE, 2.4Ghz, and new
5Ghz wifi.

The new wired Gigabit Ethernet is not promised to provide
full-speed GigE rates; though it's compatibile with GigE,
the top speed clocks out somewhere around 300 megabits 
because of the limitations of the USB 2.0 design. Still,
this is about triple what the Pi 3 B is capable of, a welcome
upgrade.

The new wifi module expands access to the 5Ghz wifi band,
which is both faster and less congested in most deployments.
Test numbers released show about double the throughput on
wifi using the new band.
