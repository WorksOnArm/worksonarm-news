### Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+

The Raspberry Pi Foundation has announced a new Raspberry Pi
model. The Model 3 B+ has a new 1.4GHz 64-bit quad-core CPU, with
dual-band 802.11ac wireless LAN, a faster Ethernet offering, and
optional Power-over-Ethernet.  If you're not using PoE, a 2.5A
micro USB power supply is required.

The improvements of the Pi 3 B+ over the Pi 3 B are incremental,
and should be welcomed by both industrial and hobbyist users of
the device. The numbering suggests that this is not a redesigned
"Pi 4", but rather a series of smaller changes that get a few
more years of life out of the design.

The system is backwards compatible with previous Pi designs,
with one small change. The Power over Ethernet header, a new
four-pin connector, is tall enough that it might require changes
to case designs and some HATs that will not have enough 
clearance for the new pins.

### Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+: 1.4 Ghz 64-bit quad-core CPU

A Broadcom BCM2837B0, Cortex-A53 (ARMv8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.4GHz is
at the heart of the new Model 3 B+. The main changes in this
new chip over the older BCM2837 have to do with heat dissipation
and power management. The new chip comes in a metal container
with a built-in heat spreader, allowing for more stability under
high loads before thermal throttling sets in.

One consideration for the new design is that it is more power-hungry
than previous versions, requiring a 2.5A 5V power supply or the
new as-yet unreleased PoE HAT.

### Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+: Faster Ethernet, faster Wifi

The new Pi 3 B+ comes with two new networking chips. The
wired networking is upgraded to a Microchip LAN7515 USB 2.0
to Gigabit Ethernet bridge, and the new wireless chip is
based on a Cypress CYW43455 module with BLE, 2.4Ghz, and new
5Ghz wifi.

The new wired Gigabit Ethernet is not promised to provide
full-speed GigE rates; though it's compatible with GigE,
the top speed clocks out somewhere around 300 megabits 
because of the limitations of the USB 2.0 design. Still,
this is about triple what the Pi 3 B is capable of, a welcome
upgrade.

The new wifi module expands access to the 5Ghz wifi band,
which is both faster and less congested in most deployments.
Test numbers released show about double the throughput on
wifi using the new band.

### Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+: Power over Ethernet hat

The one new connector on the Model 3 B+ is a new 4-pin Power
over Ethernet connector, designed for use with a new HAT 
board that will have a power transformer and fan. We're
still waiting to see the design for both sides of that
board, which has only been pictured fan-side up.

PoE is an important feature for dense network designs, 
allowing the computer to be powered and connected to the
network through a single set of wires. 

Previous designs (like the Kickstarter backed Pi Supply "Pi PoE Switch HAT")
have done this before, but the new design takes advantage 
of the new connector, making it even compact than the
original effort.

### Windows on ARM: Day-One Developer Experience 

Microsoft MVP Lance McCarthy goes through the steps of
getting a new Windows 10 on Arm system up and running.
This walk-through identifies how to set up your device
to develop and debug applications on the new operating
system. As with any new system there are a few things
about it that are new and not obvious, and Lance does
a good job with screen captures to point out the places
where a day one developer will need to pay attention.

> I will say this: I am very impressed, it’s just Windows 10 and I
really wouldn’t be able to tell it was on ARM until I realized that
it’s been 2 weeks since I last charged it!

### Bringing up Windows 10 AArch64 on a $50 Single Board Computer

Daniel (imbusho) provides a technical breakdown of running Windows
10 on Arm on a device it's not designed for. He uses a DragonBoard
410c, and implements EDK2/TianoCore to get a UEFI boot enviroment.
There's a lot of detail here, enough to get a start on it if you
are a firmware developer familiar with the kernel, but not something
aimed at an end user.

The warning is instructive:

### Ampere at OCP Summit

Ampere Computing will be at booth A32 at this year's Open Computing
Platform Summit with their first public demonstrations of the Ampere
eMAG processors. The event will include technical demos of Ampere
eMAG in action including live performance and value proposition of
Apache Cassandra on the Ampere eMAG processor and additional demos
with partners.

The 2018 Open Compute Project (OCP) US Summit will be held March
20 - 21 at the San Jose Convention Center.

### US Government blocks Broadcom acquisitiion of Qualcomm

The US Government has nixed Broadcom's proposed acquisition of
Qualcomm on national security considerations. The $117 billion
deal was fiercely fought by Qualcomm, which wanted to stay
independent to protect its extensive R&D efforts.
