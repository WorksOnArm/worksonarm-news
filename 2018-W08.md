### Kubernetes Cluster on Pine64 (Carlos Eduardo)

Carlos Eduardo has an extended writeup on the design choices
he made in building a Kubernetes cluster from 64-bit Arm 
single-board computers. 

"I ended up choosing the Rock64 SBC from Pine64, a quad-core A53
ARM board that can run 64bit Linux, 4GB RAM and a eMMC connector
to use this kind of memory instead of the slow-as-molasses SDCards
used on the Pi."

The software side of the build uses Kubernetes 1.9.3, Weave as the overlay network,
MetalLB as a load balancer, Traefik as an ingress controller, and
DNS provided by DD-WRT on his Netgear router.

All of the scripts and manifests needed to do this build are
available for inspection or to run your own on Carlos's Github
repository.

### Neutis, quad-core system on module from Emlid (Embedded World)

The Neutis is a quad-core A53 system on module from Emlid to be
debuted at next week's Embedded World. It is based on the Allwinner
H5, with a mainline Linux kernel available. For $49 (Q1) you get
8GB of eMMC storage, 512MB of DDR3 RAM, Wifi and Bluetooth, and
support for Yocto and Debian. The module is designed for embedded
use and has an extended temperature range. 

A development kit is planned which will bring out all interfaces
to full-sized connectors for ease of prototyping.

Emlidâ€™s booth (3A-545) at Embedded World 2018 will have more information.
