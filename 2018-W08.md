### Kubernetes Cluster on Pine64 (Carlos Eduardo)

Carlos Eduardo has an extended writeup on the design choices
he made in building a Kubernetes cluster from 64-bit Arm 
single-board computers. 

"I ended up choosing the Rock64 SBC from Pine64, a quad-core A53
ARM board that can run 64bit Linux, 4GB RAM and a eMMC connector
to use this kind of memory instead of the slow-as-molasses SDCards
used on the Pi."

The software side of the build uses Kubernetes 1.9.3, Weave as the overlay network,
MetalLB as a load balancer, Traefik as an ingress controller, and
DNS provided by DD-WRT on his Netgear router.

All of the scripts and manifests needed to do this build are
available for inspection or to run yourself via Carlos's Github
repository.

### Neutis, quad-core system on module from Emlid (Embedded World)

The Neutis is a quad-core A53 system on module from Emlid to be
debuted at next week's Embedded World. It is based on the Allwinner
H5, with a mainline Linux kernel available. For $49 (Q1) you get
8GB of eMMC storage, 512MB of DDR3 RAM, Wifi and Bluetooth, and
support for Yocto and Debian. The module is designed for embedded
use and has an extended temperature range. 

A development kit is planned which will bring out all interfaces
to full-sized connectors for ease of prototyping.

Emlid’s booth (3A-545) at Embedded World 2018 will have more information.

### 4.15.4 kernel with Spectre/Meltdown mitigation (via Peter Robinson, Fedora)

Peter Robinson notes via Twitter that the Linux 4.15.4 kernel is
available now with Spectre and Meltdown mitigation for arm64.

### Deploying Ceph with Rook.io on arm64 (Alexandre Marangone)

Alexandre Marangone (_alram) has built an arm64 cluster
of single-board computers to test the Ceph file system. He
reports: "That was fast. Ceph deployed in minutes on ARM64 SBCs using http://rook.io"
Look for a full writeup to follow.

### Hatch, Qualcomm at Mobile World Congress

Venturebeat reports on Hatch's plans to live-stream games from
Qualcomm's Centriq 2400 64-bit Arm systems. "Games on Hatch live
in the cloud, so playing is instant — with no downloads, updates,
or in-app purchases." To pull this off they need a fast and
efficient processor in the cloud, plus a low-latency network
to allow for streaming.

Hatch will show off these systems at Qualcomm’s booth at the Mobile World
Congress event in Barcelona from February 26 to March 1.
