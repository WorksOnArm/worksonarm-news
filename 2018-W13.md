### HypriotOS 1.8.0

HypriotOS is a Debian based distribution for the Raspberry
Pi specifically designed and configured to make it easy
to run container-based workloads with Docker and Kubernetes
on the Pi.

### Plex media server on Raspberry Pi with Docker (MagPi April 2018)

The MagPi is the official magazine for the Raspberry Pi.

New MagPi April 2018 has a beginnerâ€™s guide to Docker on ARM Raspberry Pi https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi-issues/MagPi68.pdf#page=48 - running Plex media server in a container.

### Humbox, a tiny/robust VM driver (work in progress)

Gustavo Niemeyer is working on Humbox, a tiny and
robust driver for virtual machines written in Go
designed to be an easy way to carve up multicore
system (like Packet's Cavium ThunderX 96-core Type 2A)
into a bunch of smaller VMs for testing or continuous
integration work.

### Elastic stack with Fluentd, ElasticSearch and Kibana (work in progress)

[Carlos Edp] is working on the EFK stack (ElasticSearch,
Fluentd, and Kibana) for his Rock64 based cluster. The
cluster ran a bit hot until he added two substantial
cooling fans to the build.
