### Nextcloud benchmarks

"Nextcloud, by its nature, scales extremely well across multiple cores 
and our tests show up to 50% better performance than a similarly priced Intel system."

Using equipment provided by the Works on Arm program, Nextcloud
evaluated their file sharing server software on Cavium ThunderX hardware.

## High-performance computing

### Sandia "Astra" supercomputer

HPCwire writes: "On track for deployment at Sandia National Labs later this year as part of the NNSA’s Arm-centric Vanguard project, Astra will be the world’s largest Arm system ever built, according to HPE." 

The Astra system will incorporate HPE Apollo 70 nodes - 2,592 two-socket systems
using a 28 core variant of the ThunderX2 processor that runs at 2 GHz - for
a total of 145,152 cores in the design. Storage will be provided by an all-flash 
Lustre parallel file system based on HPE’s Apollo 4250 storage server nodes, and
networking uses a 100 Gb/sec EDR InfiniBand interconnect from Mellanox Technologies.

### Fujitsu Post-K

The Fujitsu Post-K project is design to "create the world's highest-performing supercomputer, 
capable of tackling a broad range of applications to solve problems not only in the 
area of science and technology, but to play a role in a wide variety of issues in society."

To accomplish this goal, Fujitsu has worked to design an Armv8-A CPU with 512-bit SVE scalable
vector extensions. It is targeted to run Linux (RHEL-based) plus the McKernel, a lightweight kernel
developed at RIKEN specifically for low-overhead high performance computing.

The Post-K prototype will be exhibited at ISC 2018, a significant international conference and exhibition for high performance computing, which will be held in Germany from June 24-28.

### 64-bit TianoCore UEFI for the Raspberry Pi 3 (with devices, Linux, FreeBSD and Windows on Arm!)

Andrei Warkentin (@andreiw on Github) has a port of 64-bit TianoCore 
UEFI firmware for the RPi3/RPi3B+ platforms, based on Ard Bisheuvel's 
64-bit and Microsoft's 32-bit implementations.
This is meant as a generally useful 64-bit UEFI implementation 
for the Pi3, good enough for most kinds of UEFI development and 
good enough for running real operating systems.

TianoCore is an open source implementation of the Unified 
Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), a critical piece of firmware 
used during the boot process on modern server systems.
