### 64-bit TianoCore UEFI for the Raspberry Pi 3 (with devices, Linux, FreeBSD and Windows on Arm!)

Andrei Warkentin (@andreiw on Github) has a port of 64-bit TianoCore UEFI firmware for the RPi3/RPi3B+ platforms, based on Ard Bisheuvel's 64-bit and Microsoft's 32-bit implementations.
This is meant as a generally useful 64-bit UEFI implementation for the Pi3, good enough for most kinds of UEFI development and good enough for running real operating systems.

TianoCore is an open source implementation of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), a critical piece of firmware used during the boot process on modern server systems.
