## CI/CD

### Building 32-bit Arm official Docker images

Tianon Gravi of Infosiftr last week started to build 
official 32-bit Arm (armv7 and armv5) images for Docker
using systems from the Works on Arm project located at
Packet. These "Type 2A2" systems have a Hisilicon Hi1616
processor, which provides native 32-bit Arm commpilation
support.

overnight for arm32v7, we were able to add arm32v5 and get it caught
up in just about the same amount of time, and we were even able to
re-enable arm32v5 support on several images where it was previously
prohibitively slow such as python, php, ruby, and even gcc!

Jenkins is the CI/CD system used here, and you can see the
current state of each of the jobs at the "doi-janky" site
linked below.

## Orchestration

### OpenStack on Arm

John Studarus is working on an OpenStack launcher that will
deploy a two-node OpenStack cluster on Packet's Type 2A
(Cavium ThunderX) systems. This is a work in progress and
will allow you to easily stand up several hosts, install
the various OpenStack components, configure the network
and start application workloads on this 64-bit Arm system.

John is a US OpenStack Ambassador and leads the OpenStack San Diego 
user group getting the community excited about OpenStack! He frequently gives 
talks on cloud security, compliance and risk management. This
work is supported by the Works on Arm project.

## Hardware

### Qualcomm Centriq 2400 architecture details

Qualcomm has released more details of their Centriq 2400
("Amberwing") platform at the 2017 Linley Processor 
Conference. The new information includes a chip diagram
describing a 60MB L3 cache, 6 channels of DDR4 memory,
32 PCIe lanes, 8 SATA ports, and 2 Gigabit Ethernet 
interfaces. The chip is built with a 10nm process, and
is expected to be commercially available by the end of
2017.

Previously, Qualcomm had disclosed some parts of the
architecture at the Hot Chips 2017 event, and reviews
of the press coverage from that presentation are also
helpful in understanding the design.

### arm64 powered desktop, laptop design from Bero

Bernhard Rosenkränzer (Bero) from the Linaro Mobile Group 
demonstrated builds of an Arm powered desktop design, using
the MACCHIATObin Marvell ARMADA 8040 quad-core system
as the core of his efforts. CNXSoft did a writeup based
on an interview with Bero by Charbax.

> Since MACCHIATOBin board complies with mini-ITX form factor, he
could simply use off the shelf parts with a standard desktop case
with power supply, NVIDIA or AMD Radeon graphics card, 16GB memory
modules, and a 2 TB SSD drive. The AMD Radeon card fried due to
overheating, so the demo was made with an NVIDIA card driven by
Nouveau open source driver. The complete system was actually run
on fully open source drivers and firmware, and Linux 4.14 mainline
with 2 extra patches.

The interview also includes a discussion of an Arm laptop 
constructed from components including the pi-top case, which
is designed to hold a Raspberry Pi which is "not bolted shut, so
it's easy to modify."

## Open issues

### Docker multiarch vs Docker Swarm

Two open issues make the user experience for running Docker Swarm
on armv7 systems like the Raspberry Pi less than ideal. The
fundamental issue is that several Arm based systems can run
a variety of types of code, and this typing based on machine
architecture is not as easy to discover as it should be.

Case in point is the Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian, which 
is capable of running both "arm32v6" (armel, with emulated
floating point) and "arm32v7" (armhf, with hardware floating point).
When presented with a multiarch Docker image, which one should
it pick? Getting that answer correct every time is the challenge.

> With the "new" manifest list for multi-arch support, there is a
corner case on ARM where the picked-up architecture is not ideal.
On a ARMv7 CPU running Docker (e.g. a Raspberry Pi 2/3), the
architecture is armhf (so with floating point hardware support).
However when pulling an image such as the official Debian, the
"armel" variant is pulled. This is compatible with ARMv7 but emulates
floating point operations instead of using the underlying hardware.

A similar but distinct problem affects Docker Swarm, which
schedules jobs across systems and has to match strings to 
make sure it knows that a system that reports as 'aarch64'
knows how to run 'arm64' binaries.
