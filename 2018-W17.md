### Ubuntu 18.04 LTS "Bionic Beaver" released on April 26

The latest Ubuntu 18.04 LTS release was announced on April 26, 2018.

### Centos 7.5.1804 

If you are running Centos on Arm and are interested in upgrading to
the latest, the arm-dev list for Centos has instructions how to pull
your release forward.

### Fedora 28

Peter Robinson has a good detailed writeup on the port of Fedora
to the new Raspberry Pi 3 B+.

on installation on several development boards.

### SHA-3 in Armv8.4-A

SHA-3 is a cryptographic hashing function. The 2017 extensions to
the Arm architecture known as Armv8.4-A include hardware support
for the SHA-3 algorithm.

### Docker Consul

Docker Consul is a distributed key-value store. Work has been
committed to bring this to a multiarch Docker container.

* https://github.com/hashicorp/docker-consul/pull/82

### LuaJIT light userdata

LuaJIT supports a 47-bit data type which is used to store
pointers as "light userdata". This conflicts with the 48-bit
data type in arm64 systems, and so work is necessary.

> Where addresses (the address of a type_info) were used as indexes,
we replaced those with (semi-human readable) strings (the mangled
type names) - ahupowerdns/luawrapper#46

> Where addresses needed to be stored for later retrieval, we boxed
them in a full userdata - ahupowerdns/luawrapper#45

> Where we were using addresses as indexes but really didn't need to,
we replaced that with luaL_ref - ahupowerdns/luawrapper#44
