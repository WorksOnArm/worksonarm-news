### Cavium announces ThunderX2; up to 256 arm64 threads

Cavium has announced that their ThunderX2 chip is now generally
available in a range of SKUs that provide systems makers with up to 256 hardware
threads. List prices run from $800 to $1,795, with the top end
offering 32 cores at 2.5 Ghz and available in a dual-socket configuration.

The launch saw support from HPE, Cray, and Atos, with lead HPC
users includng Sandia National Labs and the Isambard project in the UK.

ThunderX2 is a new chip, not derived from the older ThunderX that
has been available for the last two years. It's based on the "Vulcan"
chips originally developed by Broadcom.

### 64-bit Arm applications for Windows 10 on Arm

At the Microsoft Build conference, Microsoft signaled availability of
a 64-bit Arm environment for Windows 10, allowing developers to build
native applications on those Qualcomm Snapdragon powered machines.

> Developers interested in targeting this new ARM-based platform
can use these early preview tools to build apps that run natively
on ARM processors rather than relying on the emulation layer. While
the algorithms that make emulation possible are engineered to
optimize performance, running your app natively allows your customers
to get the most performance and capability from your app on this
new category of devices.

### Newport GW6400/GW6404 Arm SBC

Gateworks has information on a new Cavium Octeon TX based arm64
single-board computer aimed at network applications, which supports
up to 5 gigabit ethernet ports, 2 SFP fiber ports, and 4 MPCIe sockets.
CNXSOFT has a good writeup and review of the system specs.

> System memory can be customized up to 4GB RAM, and internal storage up to 64GB eMMC flash. The company provides both OpenWrt and Ubuntu BSPs for the boards, as well as u-boot source code, and Gateworks System Controller MCU firmware code that handle RTC, voltage & temperature monitor, fan speed control, and so on. You’ll find documentation in the dedicated Wiki.
