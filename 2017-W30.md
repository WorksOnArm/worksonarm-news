#### In this issue

* Go 1.9 RC 1
* Docker 17.07.0-rc1
* Naming things
* ARM64 support in the Guix package manager

### Go 1.9 RC 1

The Go programming language has [announced availability of Go 1.9 RC 1]
to the community. This release reflects the
stability of Go 1.9, and as part of the test process Google
puts Go release candidates into production.

Like the earlier beta releases of Go, this version comes
with ARM64 binaries, which are available for you to test.
There are a small number of bugs still remaining, with
at this writing 4 open and 609 closed on the Go 1.9 milestone.

Benchmarks of any complex system will depend heavily on your
workload. [One benchmark report] provided on a single-core A57
platform shows speedups of anywhere from negligible to over 2x
on a standardized workload. Your benchmark experience will differ.

Go 1.9 release notes are not finished, but a
set of [draft release notes for Go 1.9] includes this statement:

> The release adds transparent monotonic time support, parallelizes
compilation of functions within a package, better supports test
helper functions, includes a new bit manipulation package, and has
a new concurrent map type.

[draft release notes for Go 1.9]:https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.9

The parallel function compilation will be a substantial
benefit on server-class ARM systems that have lots of cores.

### Docker 17.07.0-rc1

Docker has made available a first release candidate of their 17.07
Community Edition software. For the first time, 17.07.0-rc1 includes ARM64
binaries, and it re-introduces support for Raspbian on 32-bit ARMv7
systems.

Rolf Neugebauer from Docker put together a set of
[LinuxKit ARM64 notes] that allow for a boot of this 
version on Packet's ARMv8 Cavium ThunderX "Type 2A" 96-core servers.

Docker has a rolling release schedule, and 17.07-ce when it ships
will be a monthly "edge" option. From the Docker documentation:

> Docker CE and EE are released quarterly, and CE also has a monthly
"Edge" option. Each Docker EE release is supported and maintained
for one year and receives security and critical bug fixes during
that period. We are also improving Docker CE maintainability by
maintaining each quarterly CE release for 4 months. That gets Docker
CE users a new 1-month window to update from one version to the
next.

Like any beta and release candidate software, there are known issues
which have some expectation of being fixed before the release goes 
official. In this particular case, 32-bit and 64-bit ARM systems
may experience difficulties with Docker Swarm mode, resulting from
inconsistencies in naming of various ARM variants. A suggested
workaround bypasses the machine check with the option `--no-resolve-image`.

The details can
be found in this [SwarmKit issue], and the blocking bug described
in this [moby issue]. If one were to want to dive straight into
the responsible code, it lives in the scheduler filter at

### Naming things

> There are 2 hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation,
naming things, and off-by-1 errors. -- Leon Bambrick

The problem experienced by Docker is not unique to that project,
or even to computer science in general. Sometimes, two different
systems give different names for the same thing, and there's a
need to normalize names to a single well-known form so that something
like a scheduler can know that it's safe to execute code on this
system. 


For example, 64-bit ARM systems are variably known
as arm64, armv8, arm64v8, and aarch64. For 32-bit ARM systems there
are even more variants. Different systems may have different capabilities
of running 32-bit codes on 64-bit systems, but there is not one
single unifying name for that capacity. 

To add to the confusion, cross-compilation may create an artifact that
was built on one operating system and processor type, but that actually
contains executable code for another system.

### ARM64 support in the Guix package manager

The [State of aarch64 on Guix] report from Efraim Flashner is a
good roundup of the current status of building packages on the Guix
package manager. Guix supports about 5200 packages for aarch64 in
their distribution, which is designed as part of the GNU system for
the GuixSD System Distribution. By comparison, x86_64 has about 5600
packages. 

The differences in package count include:

* Guix uses [SableVM] as its Java implmentation. SableVM is not actively
maintained anymore, according to the project homepage, and has not
been ported to aarch64. (In other distributions, the role would be
played by OpenJDK or the Oracle JDK.)

[SableVM]:http://www.sablevm.org/

* Guix provides Go 1.4, which is too early for aarch64 support. As noted
above, the Go 1.9 release will ship with aarch64 binaries.

* [OCaml] 4.01.0 is the release targeted by Guix, but 
the latest version of OCaml is 4.05.0. aarch64 support for
OCaml appeared in release 4.02.

[OCaml]:https://ocaml.org/

* [ghc], a Haskell compiler, has no upstream support for aarch64.
This alone accounts for nearly 300 of the missing packages.

[ghc]:https://www.haskell.org/ghc/

[State of aarch64 on Guix]:https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/news/state-of-aarch64-on-guix.html

It's always good to see a new software distribution tackle ARM64 support.
Any commitment to compile and build 1000s of packages for ARM is
worthy of interest, even if you don't have immediate plans to use
the distribution yourself, because it flushes out pieces of the 
code path that might otherwise be rarely used.

### Colophon

It's a good thing I didn't try to put together a W29
version, because I didn't have cell phone service most
of my vacation.
