Arm Architecture HPC Workshop by Linaro and HiSilicon on 26th July 2018

> How does the Arm-Powered supercomputing future look and how can you prepare for it? The Arm Architecture HPC Workshop will bring together the leading Arm vendors, end users and the open source development community in the Bay area, to discuss the latest products, developments and open source software support.

## HPC

OpenHPC joins the Works on Arm cluster, using an OpenSUSE instance
running on a Packet c1.large.arm Cavium ThunderX system to run
the Open Build Service. We hope to have some kind of useful artifact
to report on in time for the Arm Architecture HPC Workshop in Santa Clara.

> OpenHPC is a collaborative, community effort that initiated from a desire to aggregate a number of common ingredients required to deploy and manage High Performance Computing (HPC) Linux clusters including provisioning tools, resource management, I/O clients, development tools, and a variety of scientific libraries. Packages provided by OpenHPC have been pre-built with HPC integration in mind with a goal to provide re-usable building blocks for the HPC community.
