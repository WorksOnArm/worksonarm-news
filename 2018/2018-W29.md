Welcome to **Works on Arm News** for Friday, July 20, 2018. This
newsletter is distributed via the @worksonarm Twitter account on
Fridays, archived at http://worksonarm.com/blog , and distributed
by electronic mail on Mondays. **Ed Vielmetti** from Packet directs the project
and writes the newsletter, and **Zoe Allen** from Packet is editor.

Ed will be at the **Arm Architecture HPC Workshop**
workshop on Thursday, July 26, 2018 in Santa Clara, CA at **Huawei** and organized
by **Linaro**. As a
consequence, next week's Issue 64 newsletter will feature a trip report of from
that workshop, and will appear perhaps somewhat later than the usual time
on Friday, July 27, 2018.

The following week (2018-W31) is PTO for Ed who will be out of the office for
the week. The Issue 65 newsletter will be a reference guide for commonly asked questions
about the newsletter, the project, and the cluster. 

## In this issue

Issue 63: Events include the Linaro Connect conference, Arm Architecture HPC Workshop, 
and Arm Research Summit. OpenHPC joins the Works on Arm cluster. Reports from the
Going Arm workshop at ISC2018. Go 1.11rc2 released; "best Go ever". icecc ("ice cream")
compiler for single-board clusters. Parallel makefiles with "make -j". 
Inventory of arm64 operating systems. RockPro64 release, and Picocluster 
plans for RockPro64 cluster. Armbian.

## Events

**Linaro Connect** will be held 17-21 September 2018 in Vancouver, BC. 
The deadline for proposals for talks is Monday July 23. 
"The leading event for Open source software engineering on Arm".

**Arm Architecture HPC Workshop** by Linaro and HiSilicon on 26th July 2018.

> How does the Arm-Powered supercomputing future look and how can you prepare for it? The Arm Architecture HPC Workshop will bring together the leading Arm vendors, end users and the open source development community in the Bay area, to discuss the latest products, developments and open source software support. 

Ed Vielmetti from Packet and Works on Arm will be attending the event; say hi to me there!

The **Arm Research Summit** is September 17-19, 2018 at Robinson College, Cambridge UK.

> In a multi-track three-day program, hear from expert researchers discussing the latest developments, future trends and disruptive technologies affecting our industry, and the world surrounding it.

Please let us know if you will be at this event!

## HPC

**OpenHPC** joins the Works on Arm cluster, using an **OpenSUSE** instance
running on a **Packet c1.large.arm Cavium ThunderX** system to run
the **Open Build Service**. 

> OpenHPC is a collaborative, community effort that initiated from a desire to aggregate a number of common ingredients required to deploy and manage High Performance Computing (HPC) Linux clusters including provisioning tools, resource management, I/O clients, development tools, and a variety of scientific libraries. Packages provided by OpenHPC have been pre-built with HPC integration in mind with a goal to provide re-usable building blocks for the HPC community. 

We hope to have a report on 
this effort
in time to share for the Arm Architecture HPC Workshop in Santa Clara.

**Going Arm** was a workshop at **ISC18**. Notes and slides from the talks presented on HPC
topics are now all online.

## Cloud native 

A beta release of **Pharmer** with support for **Kubernetes 1.11** has been
released. This system does bare-metal high availability provisioning
of Kubernetes clusters to a variety of cloud and bare metal systems
including Packet.

## Languages and libraries

**Go 1.11rc2** has been released, "the best Go ever". This release
includes several additional optimizations for arm64. If you have
the means to test your Go-based project to build for RC2, this
is an opportune time to do so to check for performance.

**icecc** ("Ice Cream") is a parallel computing environment
for clusters of machines including single-board computers
running C and C++ compiles. In this video, Sahaj from Linaro
demonstates the use of icecc to speed up compiles by distributing
the opearations over a 12 machine, 96 core cluster.

## Operating Systems

**RunsOnARM** is a list maintained by Github user @FabioLolix
to collect information about operating systems that run on 64-bit
arm64 single-board computers.

## Command of the week is "make -j"

The `make -j` option is a necessary feature for fast compiles
if you are building software on a manycore system like the
Packet **c1.large.arm** systems found in the Works on Arm cluster.
Use it to configure the number of jobs running at once, or to 
run an unlimited number of jobs. 

> If the ‘-j’ option is followed by an integer, this is the number of recipes to execute at once; this is called the number of job slots. If there is nothing looking like an integer after the ‘-j’ option, there is no limit on the number of job slots. The default number of job slots is one, which means serial execution (one thing at a time).
