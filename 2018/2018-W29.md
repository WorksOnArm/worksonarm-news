Ed Vielmetti, the writer of the Works on Arm newsletter and the director of
the Works on Arm cluster at Packet, will be at the Linaro Arm Hisilicon HPC
workshop on Thursday, July 26, 2018 in Santa Clara, CA at Huawei. As a
consequence, next week's newsletter will feature a trip report of from
that workshop, and will appear perhaps somewhat later than the usual time
on Friday, July 27, 2018.

The following week (2018-W31) is PTO for Ed who will be out of the office for
the week. The newsletter will be a reference guide for commonly asked questions
about the newsletter, the project, and the cluster. 

In this issue: Events include the Linaro Connect conference, Arm Architecture HPC Workshop, 
Arm Research Summit. OpenHPC joins the Works on Arm cluster. Reports from the
Going Arm workshop at ISC2018. Go 1.11rc2 released; "best Go ever". icecc ("ice cream")
compiler for single-board clusters. Parallel makefiles with "make -j". 
Inventory of arm64 operating systems. RockPro64 release, and Picocluster plans for RockPro64 cluster. Armbian.

Arm Architecture HPC Workshop by Linaro and HiSilicon on 26th July 2018.

> How does the Arm-Powered supercomputing future look and how can you prepare for it? The Arm Architecture HPC Workshop will bring together the leading Arm vendors, end users and the open source development community in the Bay area, to discuss the latest products, developments and open source software support. 

Ed Vielmetti from Packet and Works on Arm will be attending the event; say hi to me there!

## HPC

OpenHPC joins the Works on Arm cluster, using an OpenSUSE instance
running on a Packet c1.large.arm Cavium ThunderX system to run
the Open Build Service. 

> OpenHPC is a collaborative, community effort that initiated from a desire to aggregate a number of common ingredients required to deploy and manage High Performance Computing (HPC) Linux clusters including provisioning tools, resource management, I/O clients, development tools, and a variety of scientific libraries. Packages provided by OpenHPC have been pre-built with HPC integration in mind with a goal to provide re-usable building blocks for the HPC community. 

We hope to have some kind of useful artifact
to report on in time for the Arm Architecture HPC Workshop in Santa Clara.
