Ed Vielmetti, the writer of the Works on Arm newsletter and the director of
the Works on Arm cluster at Packet, will be at the Linaro Arm Hisilicon HPC
workshop on Thursday, July 26, 2018 in Santa Clara, CA at Huawei. As a
consequence, next week's newsletter will feature a trip report of from
that conference, and will appear perhaps somewhat later than the usual time
on Friday, July 27, 2018.

The following week (2018-W31) is PTO for Ed who will be out of the office for
