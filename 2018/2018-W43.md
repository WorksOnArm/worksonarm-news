### Arm Neoverse roadmap for server-class systems

At Arm TechCon, Arm announced a roadmap for server-class
systems called Neoverse. The company plans to release
IP that will enable licensees to build fast multi-core
systems without going through the expense and bother
of designing their own CPU cores. The roadmap includes
7nm and 5nm parts with an annual cadence for improvements.

Neoverse is part of a broader strategy that identifies
opportunities for Arm based systems, with a
"cloud to edge infrastructure foundation for a world of one trillion intelligent devices".

### Linux kernel to support big/little process scheduling (Phoronix)

The plan is to better handle "misfit" tasks, which
need more CPU but are currently scheduled on a slower
"little" core. The patch lands in the 4.20 kernel.
This is primarily targeted at CPU cores that incorporate
fast high speed cores with slower but more memory efficient
secondary cores.

### Fedora 29 is on its way

Fedora 29 is due to be shipped live on Tuesday, October 30, 2018.
Improvements in the release target IOT support for smaller
32-bit and 64-bit Arm devices, including newly improved
ZRAM support for swap in memory constrained devices. Fedora
29 is one of the first operating systems also to support Go 1.11,
which has substantial performance improvements over earlier Go 
releases on arm64 especially on crypto codes.

### NetBSD ARM64 images for SBSA compliant systems

Jared McNeill has been working on code to boot NetBSD
cleanly on SBSA compliant systems. SBSA ("Server Base System Architecture")
is a standard for arm64 server designs, with the goal
that a server will be able to support booting a wide
range of operating systems without the OS vendor needing
to customize the boot code for each vendor hardware.

### ARMv8.3 has an instruction just for Javascript

The FJCVTZS ("Floating-point Javascript convert to signed fixed-point, rounding
toward zero") instruction is new in the ARMv8.3 instruction set.
The Javascript language lacks an integer type, so this 
routine efficiently handles a common float-to-int with
appropriate semantics.

To take advantage of this, you'll need support in your CPU
(like the latest Apple A12) as well as in your Javascript
interpreter or JIT. Where it's implemented, codes show an
overall 0.5% to 2% improvement, with crypto codes like AES
and SHA256 showing the biggest speedups.
