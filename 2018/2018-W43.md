### Arm Neoverse roadmap for server-class systems

At Arm TechCon, Arm announced a roadmap for server-class
systems called Neoverse.

### Linux kernel to support big/little process scheduling (Phoronix)

The plan is to better handle "misfit" tasks, which
need more CPU but are currently scheduled on a slower
"little" core. The patch lands in the 4.20 kernel.

### Fedora 29 is on its way

Fedora 29 is due to be shipped live on Tuesday, October 30, 2018.

### NetBSD ARM64 images for SBSA compliant systems

Jared McNeill has been working on code to boot NetBSD
cleanly on SBSA compliant systems. SBSA ("Server Base System Architecture")
is a standard for arm64 server designs, with the goal
that a server will be able to support booting a wide
range of operating systems without the OS vendor needing
to customize the boot code for each vendor hardware.
