### Sandia Labs ASTRA supercomputer in Top500 list

> For the first time, an ARM-powered supercomputer has made it into
the TOP500 rankings. The new system, known as Astra, is an HPE-built
supercomputer deployed at Sandia National Laboratories. It’s powered
by 125,328 Cavium ThunderX2 cores and has achieved an HPL Linpack
score of 1.5 petaflops. It enters the list at number 205.
