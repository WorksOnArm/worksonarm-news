### Sandia Labs ASTRA supercomputer in Top500 list

Arm is well represented at this week's SC18 supercomputing
show in Dallas. Leading the news is the appearance of
Sandia's "Astra" supercomputer on the TOP500 ranking of
the world's fastest systems.

> For the first time, an ARM-powered supercomputer has made it into
the TOP500 rankings. The new system, known as Astra, is an HPE-built
supercomputer deployed at Sandia National Laboratories. It’s powered
by 125,328 Cavium ThunderX2 cores and has achieved an HPL Linpack
score of 1.5 petaflops. It enters the list at number 205.

### SUSE Linux for Arm in manufacturing

The first success story of a SUSE customer using SLES for Arm on a 
Raspberry Pi to improve manufacturing efficiency has been published here,
via Jay Kruemcke from SUSE.

> Knorr-Bremse chose to use Raspberry Pi devices to collect data from 
manufacturing machines. The small, inexpensive singleboard computers are 
ideal for building connected IoT solutions. Next, the company selected 
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for ARM as the operating system to 
support its innovative Raspberry Pi project.

### OpenBSD/arm64 on QEMU with networking

0x16h (Cryogenix) has a nice writeup on getting an emulated
arm64 system running OpenBSD running under QEMU. The system
was set up to support writing a tutorial on assembly language
programming for OpenBSD with an emphasis on development for
the kernel.

### Windows 10 official support for arm64 developement tools

> Developers can use Visual Studio 15.9 today to recompile apps –
both UWP and C++ Win32 – to run natively on Windows 10 on ARM
devices. Running natively allows applications to take full advantage
of the processing power and capabilities of Windows 10 on ARM
devices, resulting in the best possible experience for users.
