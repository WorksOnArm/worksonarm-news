### Amazon EC2 a1 instance supports arm64

The new Amazon a1 instance type uses arm64 cores (from 1 to 16 at a time)
to power a new service aimed at scale-out workloads. The new EC2 product
offering is powered by Graviton chips, which were developed in-house by
Amazon after its acquisition of Annapurna Labs in 2015.

### Chrome web browser to get arm64 support on Windows 10

As part of Microsoft's move to adopt Chrome as the new basis
for their Edge browser, they have committed to native arm64
support for Windows 10. The work is being done in partnership
with Google, and you can track changes via the issue tracker for
the open source Chromium browser.

### Firefox web browser to get arm64 support on Windows 10

Mozilla is leading the way to produce native arm64 support for
the Firefox browser on Windows 10. The project targets the
specific hardware support for the Qualcomm Snapdragon processors
found in the newest generations of Arm based Windows 10 laptops.

### Official Ubuntu 18.04. for Raspberry Pi 3 beta

Canonical has launched a beta program for their new release
of Ubuntu 18.04 targeting arm64 for the Raspberry Pi 3B and 3B+.
The release comes with full support for video, network, wifi and
is available as a ready-to-boot image for your Pi's SD card.

### CentOS Linux 7 (1806) for arm64

Red Hat announces CentOS Linux 7 (1806) targeting arm64 and
other "alternative architectures". The release is based on
the source tree for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6. A full set
of release notes accompanies the distribution, describing 
differences from previous releases.

### Fedora 29 on arm64 on AWS

A release of Fedora 29 for arm64 is available on Amazon Web
Services targeting the new a1 EC2 instance type. Community 
support can be found on the Fedora ARM project mailing list.

### NetBSD running on Amazon a1 arm64 instance

The NetBSD project is successfully booting this operating
system on Amazon's arm64 based a1 EC2 instance. Jared McNeill
has been leading the work. NetBSD is a free, fast, secure, 
and highly portable Unix-like Open Source operating system.

### New Docker Hub with easy search for multiarch images

Docker has a announced a new Docker Hub, with improved
support for finding official and supported images that
have arm64 support. The new user interface incorporates
elements from the Docker Store. Docker users can easily
identify a compatible image that supports the architecture
of their choice. Almost 5000 images in the Docker Hub
repository, including over 100 official images, support
the arm64 platform.

### Rancher, Arm collaborate for Kubernetes at the edge

Rancher and Arm have announced a collaboration that will
bring a new edge focus to Kubernetes operations, looking
particularly at improvements that will decrease memory
consumption and add to performance. The target application
uses small Kubernetes clusters at the edge of the network
to collect and distribute sensor data.

### Embree3 ray tracing software

Syoyo Fujita has ported Intel's "Embree" ray tracing
software to arm64, taking advantage of work that had
been earlier done by Martin Chang. A piece of the 
port is accomplished with the help of `SSE2NEON.h`,
a C/C++ header file that converts Intel SSE intrinsics to ARN NEON intrinsics.

### Facebook BOLT speeds up arm64 binaries by up to 15%

Facebook's new BOLT binary optimatization tool acts as a
post-processor for binaries, speeding up their performance
by improving memory access locality. It achieves the improvements 
by optimizing application's code layout based on execution 
profile gathered by sampling profiler, such as Linux perf tool.
BOLT heavily uses LLVM libraries, and by design, it is built 
as one of LLVM tools.
