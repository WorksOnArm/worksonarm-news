### Storpool

StorPool is distributed storage software which runs on standard hardware  - servers, drives, network - 
and turns them into high-performance storage system. Its new 18.02 release includes support
for arm64, block storage for Kubernetes, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

Boyan Krosnov writes about the port to Arm and how current server designs
stack up for the storage use case.

> In particular use-cases, they can help us achieve unprecedented 
power efficiency and storage density. Especially Arm server chips 
with many PCIe lanes, are very interesting for high-density NVMe 
storage nodes and for high-density HDD storage nodes.

### Numba 0.42 rc1/2 with some 32-bit and 64-bit Arm support

Numba is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of 
Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. In the latest 0.42
release candidates, it now has some support for 32-bit Arm (through
the "Berryconda" project) and for 64-bit Arm (through the "Jetconda"
project).

### Rancher for Raspberry Pi 3 test build

The first pieces of Rancher's announced forthcoming support for arm64
and a lightweight Kubernetes distribution for the edge
have emerged as a Hypriot based example for the Raspberry Pi 3.

### FreeBSD support bhyve hypervisor port to arm64

The FreeBSD Foundation provided support to Alexandru Elisei, a student at
University Politehnica of Bucharest, to port the bhyve hypervisor to arm64.
Alexandru is now working at internship at Arm in Cambridge
in the System Validation on Operating Systems team. His presentation
on "Virtualization on ARMv8A bhyvearm64 Current Status" was given at
Asia BSDCon in March 2018.

### Julia 1.0.3 has arm64 support for the first time since 0.6

Julia is a scientific computing language that uses the LLVM
back end to support code generation. The Julia 1.0.3 release
now has support for arm64.

### Weaveworks Scope port to arm64

Weave Scope automatically generates a map of your application, 
enabling you to intuitively understand, monitor, and control your 
containerized, microservices-based application. Carlos Eduardo
has undertaken a port of this package to arm64 and has a set of
patches that are under review.

### Fedora 29 and wifi on Raspberry Pi 3

The release of Fedora 29 for the Raspberry Pi 3 has 
seen several kernel-level issues with support for
wifi on that device. Peter Robinson of the Fedora Project
report that it "should be fixed with kernel 4.19.10 for F-28/F-29."

### Roaring Bitmaps support for NEON 

Roaring bitmaps are compressed bitmaps which tend to 
outperform conventional compressed bitmaps such as WAH, 
EWAH or Concise. They are used by several major systems such 
as Apache Lucene and derivative systems such as Solr and Elasticsearch, 
Metamarkets' Druid, LinkedIn Pinot, Netflix Atlas, Apache Spark, 
OpenSearchServer, Cloud Torrent, Whoosh, InfluxDB, Pilosa, Bleve, 
Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), and eBay's Apache Kylin.

A recent set of patches by Andrei Gudkov add support
for vector opertions (NEON or SIMD) for arm64, and result
in substantial performance improvements (up to 5x for some
microbenchmarks). These are available on the "master" branch
at the moment and have not yet been released.
