The Arm Architecture HPC Workshop on 
Thursday, July 26, 2018 was held at Huawei in Santa Clara, CA  
and organized by Linaro and sponsored by Arm. 
This week’s Issue 64 newsletter features a trip report from that workshop,
augmented by news from the [Hot Chips 30](https://www.hotchips.org/)
conference held in Cupertino, CA on August 19-21, 2018.

Packet and Works on Arm will be well represented at Open Source Summit North
America in Vancouver, BC, Canada on August 29-31, 2018. Look for our
booth at the show. 

SWAG!!! If you would like any Works on Arm swag - stickers etc - please 
contact help@packet.net with the word "Swag" and we'll take care
of you. Let us know if you're willing and able to be a distribution point
for companies, licensees, conferences, workshops, meetings etc. SWAG!!!

## Drone.IO offers Arm CI/CD infrastructure

Drone.io has announced official support for Arm architectures, expanding its
reach for developers in the  IoT and embedded device ecosystems.

Drone.io is an open source cloud native continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) platform.
It now supports Armv7-A and Armv8-A, helping developers create software experiences for the embedded, IoT, 
accelerator, and server ecosystem built on Arm’s architecture. 
You can get started by installing the Drone 0.9 technology preview.

Using Drone.io, software developers can now test and deploy seamlessly across 
both x86 and Arm architectures. With this announcement, Drone.io also introduced Arm 
support for many of the most popular plugins in its marketplace, including Slack, GitHub, and Docker.

## Arm Architecture HPC Workshop, Santa Clara, CA

The Arm Architecture HPC Workshop by Linaro and HiSilicon 
was held on July 26, 2018 on the Huawei campus in Santa Clara, CA.
The workshop looked at the Arm-powered supercomputing future and
helped prepare software and hardware people for upcoming
opportunities. Leading Arm vendors, end users, and open source
developers from the Bay area and around the world came together
to discuss software, hardware, projects, and the latest products and product
plans.

The event website at https://www.linaro.org/latest/events/arm-hpc-santa-clara-2018/
contains a full agenda and some of the presentations. 

## Isambard: the world's first production Arm-based supercomputer	

Simon Mcintosh-Smith from the	University of Bristol presented on the 
topic of Isambard, a production supercomputer in the UK.
The Cray XC50 Scout system combines Cavium
ThunderX2 Arm-based CPUs with Cray’s Aries interconnect.

## Vanguard Astra: Petascale Arm Platform for U.S. DOE/ASC Supercomputing

Andrew J. Younge	of Sandia National Laboratories spoke about 
Vanguard Astra, a large-scale experimental computing installation
designed to demonstrate viability for production use for the NNSA.
Astra will be based on the HPE Apollo 70, which uses Cavium ThunderX2
chips, Mellanox CX-5 NICs. The system will have 2592 nodes and
will consume 1.2 MW of power, producing 2.3 PFLOPs peak compute
capacity.

## Post-K and Arm HPC Ecosystem: RIKEN and Fujitsu, Japan

Dr. Yutaka Ishikawa	of RIKEN spoke on the Fujitsu designed Post-K
computer. The system is in the design stages now, aimed to be
in production in 2022, and when complete it will be the Japanese
flagship national supercomputer system.

## HPC network stack on Arm (Pavel Shamis, Arm)

Pavel Shamis (Pasha) of Arm spoke primarily about MPI, the message passing
interface used by scientific computing codes, and two
related projects MPICH and MVAPICH. MPI supports
"every possible and impossible exotic network device",
and because of this complexity and a robust test suite
he called upon the community to contribute to the MPI
test environments.

## SUSE enablement for Arm (Jay Kruemcke, SUSE)

Jay Kruemcke from SUSE spoke on the topic of SUSE
and OpenSUSE for Arm, and noted that SUSE was
now shipping builds for arm64 and amd64 nearly
simultaneously.

## Huawei’s requirements for the ARM based HPC solution readiness	(Joshua Mora, Huawei)

Joshua Mora of Huawei spoke to the hardware and architecture
needs that were identified as they progress from the Hisilicon
Hi1616 to a future Hi1620 system. He spelled out requirements
that as an organization they needed to attain in order to
be competitors in the HPC space.
