## Drone.IO offers Arm CI/CD infrastructure

Drone.io has announced official support for Arm architectures, expanding its
reach for developers in the  IoT and embedded device ecosystems.

Drone.io is an open source cloud native continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) platform.
It now supports Armv7-A and Armv8-A, helping developers create software experiences for the embedded, IoT, 
accelerator, and server ecosystem built on Arm’s architecture. 
You can get started by installing the Drone 0.9 technology preview.

Using Drone.io, software developers can now test and deploy seamlessly across 
both x86 and Arm architectures. With this announcement, Drone.io also introduced Arm 
support for many of the most popular plugins in its marketplace, including Slack, GitHub, and Docker.

## Arm Architecture HPC Workshop, Santa Clara, CA

The Arm Architecture HPC Workshop by Linaro and HiSilicon 
was held on July 26, 2018 on the Huawei campus in Santa Clara, CA.
The workshop looked at the Arm-powered supercomputing future and
helped prepare software and hardware people for upcoming
opportunities. Leading Arm vendors, end users, and open source
developers from the Bay area and around the world came together
to discuss software, hardware, projects, and the latest products and product
plans.

The event website at https://www.linaro.org/latest/events/arm-hpc-santa-clara-2018/
contains a full agenda and some of the presentations. 

## Isambard: the world's first production Arm-based supercomputer	

Simon Mcintosh-Smith from the	University of Bristol presented on the 
topic of Isambard, a production supercomputer in the UK.

## Vanguard Astra: Petascale Arm Platform for U.S. DOE/ASC Supercomputing

Andrew J. Younge	of Sandia National Laboratories spoke about 
Vanguard Astra, a large-scale experimental computing installation
designed to demonstrate viability for production use for the NNSA.
Astra will be based on the HPE Apollo 70, which uses Cavium ThunderX2
chips, Mellanox CX-5 NICs. The system will have 2592 nodes and
will consume 1.2 MW of power, producing 2.3 PFLOPs peak compute
capacity.
