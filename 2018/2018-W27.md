## New in the Works on Arm cluster for May and June 2018

The Works on Arm cluster offers resources for projects doing
development, testing, and CI/CD on Arm. Periodically I report
back here on new projects that are underway and some sense of
their status. Details of project engagement are kept in a Github
issue tracker at http://github.com/WorksOnArm/cluster .

### ElectronJS (#58)

Electron allows developers to build cross platform desktop 
apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Supported platforms are 
macOS, Windows (ia32 and x64), and Linux ia32, x64, armv7 and armv8).

The Electron build system relies on Microsoft's Visual
Studio Team Services (VSTS), which in turn relies on the
.NET Core CLR runtime. Work is progressing to get full
arm64 support for all of this development tooling.

### Adélie Linux (#59)

Adélie Linux is a Free, Libre operating system based on the 
Linux kernel. Our goals of full POSIX® compliance, compatibility 
with a wide variety of computers, and ease of use without sacrificing 
features set us apart from most other Linux distributions.

Adélie Linux uses the Works on Arm infrastructure to support
a port to arm64. The project uses Gitlab for collaboration,
source code management, and testing.

## New in the Works on Arm directory 

The Works on Arm directory is a reference guide to
software and systems that have been developed for
or ported to arm64 server-class hardware. While it
is by its nature incomplete - new software appears
daily - it does provide a handy reference for identifying
more information when bringing your favorite codes 
to a new arm64 based platform.

### Directory update: databases

Entries for the following databases have been updated or added
in the Works on Arm directory.

* CockroachDB - https://www.worksonarm.com/explore/cockroachdb
* MongoDB - https://www.worksonarm.com/explore/mongodb/
* Prometheus - https://www.worksonarm.com/explore/prometheus/
* MariaDB - https://www.worksonarm.com/explore/mariadb/

In addition, we are working on updates for the following
databases, each of which have some level of support for arm64
systems. Look for news in future editions of this newsletter.

* Elasticsearch
* LMDB
* Memcached
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* RethinkDB

## Automation

Packet provides a highly automated environment for setting
up and managing bare metal servers, including the servers
found in the Works on Arm cluster. Program participants can
make use of programmable tools like Terraform, Ansible,
cloud-init and fog to set up and configure servers.

If you are interested in automation at Packet, see the
#integration channel on the Packet Community Slack, which
you can join via http://slack.packet.net .

### Packet support for Vagrant

A new provisioner in early testing for Packet is support
for Hashicorp's Vagrant. HashiCorp Vagrant provides the 
same, easy workflow regardless of your role as a developer, 
operator, or designer. It leverages a declarative configuration 
file which describes all your software requirements, packages, 
operating system configuration, users, and more.

The new provider, `vagrant-packet`, was developed by
Jeffrey Sica at the University of Michigan. This code
leverages the work that was done at Packet on the `fog`
provisioning tool, and lets you set up servers at Packet
as easily as typing `vagrant up`.

### Outernet "Dreamcatcher 3"

> The receiver is called 'Dreamcatcher 3', and is a custom PCB 
containing a hardware receiver (non-SDR based) with a LoRa decoder, 
as well as an embedded ARM computer capable of running Linux.
