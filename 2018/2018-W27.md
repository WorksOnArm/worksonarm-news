## High Performance Computing

### Simon McIntosh-Smith at Arm Architecture HPC Workshop, July 26, 2018, Santa Clara CA

> Linaro is pleased to announce the first speaker at our Arm Architecture HPC workshop in Santa Clara on July 26th.
Simon McIntosh-Smith will give a talk at about Isambard: the world's first production Arm-based supercomputer.

## New in the Works on Arm cluster for May and June 2018

The Works on Arm cluster offers resources for projects doing
development, testing, and CI/CD on Arm. Periodically I report
back here on new projects that are underway and some sense of
their status. Details of project engagement are kept in a Github
issue tracker at http://github.com/WorksOnArm/cluster .

### ElectronJS (#58)

Electron allows developers to build cross platform desktop 
apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Supported platforms are 
macOS, Windows (ia32 and x64), and Linux ia32, x64, armv7 and armv8).

The Electron build system relies on Microsoft's Visual
Studio Team Services (VSTS), which in turn relies on the
.NET Core CLR runtime. Work is progressing to get full
arm64 support for all of this development tooling.

### Adélie Linux (#59)

Adélie Linux is a Free, Libre operating system based on the 
Linux kernel. Our goals of full POSIX® compliance, compatibility 
with a wide variety of computers, and ease of use without sacrificing 
features set us apart from most other Linux distributions.

Adélie Linux uses the Works on Arm infrastructure to support
a port to arm64. The project uses Gitlab for collaboration,
source code management, and testing.

## New in the Works on Arm directory 

The Works on Arm directory is a reference guide to
software and systems that have been developed for
or ported to arm64 server-class hardware. While it
is by its nature incomplete - new software appears
daily - it does provide a handy reference for identifying
more information when bringing your favorite codes 
to a new arm64 based platform.

### Directory update: databases

Entries for the following databases have been updated or added
in the Works on Arm directory.

* CockroachDB - https://www.worksonarm.com/explore/cockroachdb
* MongoDB - https://www.worksonarm.com/explore/mongodb/
* Prometheus - https://www.worksonarm.com/explore/prometheus/
* MariaDB - https://www.worksonarm.com/explore/mariadb/

In addition, we are working on updates for the following
databases, each of which have some level of support for arm64
systems. Look for news in future editions of this newsletter.

* Elasticsearch
* LMDB
* Memcached
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* RethinkDB

## Automation

Packet provides a highly automated environment for setting
up and managing bare metal servers, including the servers
found in the Works on Arm cluster. Program participants can
make use of programmable tools like Terraform, Ansible,
cloud-init and fog to set up and configure servers.

If you are interested in automation at Packet, see the
#integration channel on the Packet Community Slack, which
you can join via http://slack.packet.net .

### Packet support for Vagrant

A new provisioner in early testing for Packet is support
for Hashicorp's Vagrant. HashiCorp Vagrant provides the 
same, easy workflow regardless of your role as a developer, 
operator, or designer. It leverages a declarative configuration 
file which describes all your software requirements, packages, 
operating system configuration, users, and more.

The new provider, `vagrant-packet`, was developed by
Jeffrey Sica at the University of Michigan. This code
leverages the work that was done at Packet on the `fog`
provisioning tool, and lets you set up servers at Packet
as easily as typing `vagrant up`.

## System monitoring

### Grafana 5.2 with arm64 support

Grafana is an open source metric analytics & visualization suite. 
It is most commonly used for visualizing time series data for 
infrastructure and application analytics but many use it in 
other domains including industrial sensors, home automation, 
weather, and process control.

As of version 5.2, Grafana is now doing native builds
of these tools for arm64. They write:

> We’ve been longing for native ARM build support for ages. 
With the help from our amazing community this is now finally 
available. Please try it out and let us know what you think.

### NanoPi "Fire 3" 96-core cluster build

Nick Smith has built a high performance 12-node NanoPi-Fire3 
supercomputer for under £100 (£550 including twelve Fire3s).

> After the interest in my cluster of Raspberry Pi 3s 
last year, I was keen to try building clusters with 
some of the other excellent SBCs now on the market. 
FriendlyARM in China very generously sent me 12 of 
their latest NanoPi-Fire3 64-bit ARM boards, each 
with an EIGHT core ARM A53 SoC running at 1.4GHz with gigabit Ethernet.

His benchmarks for scientific computing use the Linpack
linear equation solver to generate 60000 MFLOPS, about
6 times the performance of the 1992-era 16-core Cray C90 supercomputer.

> 60,000 MFLOPS isn’t all that fast by current performance standards, 
but back in 2000 the 12-node Fire3 cluster would have made 
it into the Top250 fastest supercomputers in the world (!).

Nick has been building quite a variety of clusters out
of single-board computers, and his builds are very tidy
through custom-built enclosures and cabling.

## Radio fun

### Outernet "Dreamcatcher 3"

Arm-based Linux systems are often used in embedded control
systems for radio applications. Outernet provides a platform
for receiving broadcast data transmissions from satellite-based
transmitters, using the highly robust LoRa protocol to 
encode transmissions for terrestrial reception.

> The receiver is called 'Dreamcatcher 3', and is a custom PCB 
containing a hardware receiver (non-SDR based) with a LoRa decoder, 
as well as an embedded ARM computer capable of running Linux.
