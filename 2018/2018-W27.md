## New in the Works on Arm cluster for May and June 2018

The Works on Arm cluster offers resources for projects doing
development, testing, and CI/CD on Arm. Periodically I report
back here on new projects that are underway and some sense of
their status.

### ElectronJS (#58)

Electron allows developers to build cross platform desktop 
apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Supported platforms are 
macOS, Windows (ia32 and x64), and Linux ia32, x64, armv7 and armv8).

The Electron build system relies on Microsoft's Visual
Studio Team Services (VSTS), which in turn relies on the
.NET Core CLR runtime. Work is progressing to get full
arm64 support for all of this development tooling.

### Adélie Linux (#59)

Adélie Linux is a Free, Libre operating system based on the 
Linux kernel. Our goals of full POSIX® compliance, compatibility 
with a wide variety of computers, and ease of use without sacrificing 
features set us apart from most other Linux distributions.

Adélie Linux uses the Works on Arm infrastructure to support
a port to arm64. The project uses Gitlab for collaboration,
source code management, and testing.
