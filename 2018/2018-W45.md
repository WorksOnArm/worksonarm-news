### ARM Powers Atos Supercomputer for CEA in France

BullSequana and Marvell have teamed up to put ThunderX2
arm64 processors into a new supercomputer for the French
Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).
Inside HPC reports:

> The new model, which will be delivered at the end of 
2018 in the ÃŽle-de-France CEA/DAM center, located at 
BruyÃ¨res-le-ChÃ¢tel, includes a BullSequana rack with 
92 BullSequana X1310 blades, three compute nodes per 
blade, dual Marvell ThunderX2 processors of 32 cores 
@ 2.2 GHz, based on the Armv8-A instruction set, with 
256 GB per node and Infiniband EDR interconnect. 

Atos will be at booth #2213 at SC18 in Dallas next week.

### Los Alamos, NNSA and Cray deploy Arm supercomputer

Data Center Dynamics reports on a new Cray/Marvell supercomputer
to support the National Nuclear Security Administration at Los Alamos.

> The US Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory 
has installed a new Cray XC50, with Marvell ThunderX2 Arm processors. 
The high performance computing (HPC) system was funded by the 
National Nuclear Security Administrationâ€™s Advanced Simulation 
and Computing Program, and will be used to run classified 
simulation code as part of the NNSA's Stockpile Stewardship Program.

NNSA had previously announced the Astra supercomputer, which
is a larger system running on the same class of hardware.

### VMWare at the edge with ESXi on Raspberry Pi

William Lam writes:

> During the closing of the VMworld Europe Keynote on Tuesday, Ray O'Farrell 
(CTO of VMware) had one more "tiny" surprise for our CEO, Pat Gelsinger ðŸ˜‰ 
He handed him a tiny little device called the Raspberry Pi (rPI) which was 
running a prototype version of ESXi! This was completely unexpected even 
for VMware Employees, especially as we had just announced our ESXi on ARM 
initiative at VMworld US. 

The ESXi on Raspberry Pi (or "ESXPi") effort is not a product, but
it shows two technology directions from VMware - reducing the memory
footprint of ESXi to allow it to run on smaller devices, and running
ESXi on Arm systems in general. Applications that have been imagined
by the community in the below links focus on edge use cases for virtualization.

### Rock Pi 4 Raspberry Pi Compatible RK3399 Board to Sell for $39 and Up

Tom Cubie of Radxa has announced the design of a new "Rock Pi 4" single
board computer. The system is designed with the same form factor as the
popular Raspberry Pi, allowing as far as possible sharing of peripherals
from that project. It distinguishes itself with a 6-core RK3399 processor,
fast Gigabit Ethernet, M.2 and eMMC storage, and up to 4 gigabytes of memory. Prices
range upwards from $39. The device is not available for order as of this writing.

### Multi-architecture arm64-ready MySQL container images available

The MySQL release team announced that as of version 8.0.13 the official
Docekr images for MySQL are multi-architecture and ready for your arm64 
system. 

> Images are built from identical Dockerfiles and we rely only on 
our existing yum support for multiple architectures. At build time 
the correct yum repo and architecture are determined and the 
according rpm package is installed.

### Marvell donates ThunderX2 to the openSUSE project

From the OpenSUSE news release:

> Marvell, which recently completed the acquisition of Cavium, 
offers a broad portfolio of infrastructure solutions. Marvell 
donated a ThunderX2 system to the openSUSE Project. The Dual-System-on-Chip 
machine with 256GB RAM and 240GB SSD will extend the existing fleet of 
ARM build hardware. This 64-bit ThunderX2 system will bring an additional 
40 ARMv8 (AArch64) concurrent build jobs to the openSUSE Open Build Service, 
which can now provide its users with faster AArch64 package and installation image builds.

### New Arm "Neoverse" brand (SemiAccurate)

Charlie Demerjian from SemiAccurate has a thorough
rundown of the new "Neoverse" branding from Arm for
its infrastructure and server-class IP. 

> That said the three new reveals, Ares, Zeus, and Poseidon 
set the tone for where ARM wants to go in the server space. 
Each step on the yearly cadence of cores/platforms is 
said to offer a 30% performance boost from the prior 
generation. More importantly you can have the same 
core architecture from cloud to edge and things like 
VMs and workloads can migrate seamlessly between. In 
theory but that is always the caveat. This is where 
things like the ServerReady program pay off.
