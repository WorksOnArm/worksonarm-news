### ARM Powers Atos Supercomputer for CEA in France

BullSequana and Marvell have teamed up to put ThunderX2
arm64 processors into a new supercomputer for the French
Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).
Inside HPC reports:

> The new model, which will be delivered at the end of 
2018 in the ÃŽle-de-France CEA/DAM center, located at 
BruyÃ¨res-le-ChÃ¢tel, includes a BullSequana rack with 
92 BullSequana X1310 blades, three compute nodes per 
blade, dual Marvell ThunderX2 processors of 32 cores 
@ 2.2 GHz, based on the Armv8-A instruction set, with 
256 GB per node and Infiniband EDR interconnect. 

Atos will be at booth #2213 at SC18 in Dallas next week.

### VMWare at the edge with ESXi on Raspberry Pi

William Lam writes:

> During the closing of the VMworld Europe Keynote on Tuesday, Ray O'Farrell 
(CTO of VMware) had one more "tiny" surprise for our CEO, Pat Gelsinger ðŸ˜‰ 
He handed him a tiny little device called the Raspberry Pi (rPI) which was 
running a prototype version of ESXi! This was completely unexpected even 
for VMware Employees, especially as we had just announced our ESXi on ARM 
initiative at VMworld US. 

The ESXi on Raspberry Pi (or "ESXPi") effort is not a product, but
it shows two technology directions from VMware - reducing the memory
footprint of ESXi to allow it to run on smaller devices, and running
ESXi on Arm systems in general. Applications that have been imagined
by the community in the below links focus on edge use cases for virtualization.

### Marvell donates ThunderX2 to the openSUSE project

From the OpenSUSE news release:

> Marvell, which recently completed the acquisition of Cavium, 
offers a broad portfolio of infrastructure solutions. Marvell 
donated a ThunderX2 system to the openSUSE Project. The Dual-System-on-Chip 
machine with 256GB RAM and 240GB SSD will extend the existing fleet of 
ARM build hardware. This 64-bit ThunderX2 system will bring an additional 
40 ARMv8 (AArch64) concurrent build jobs to the openSUSE Open Build Service, 
which can now provide its users with faster AArch64 package and installation image builds.
