### Cadence support on ThunderX2

At Arm TechCon, Cadence announced support for its
Cadence Verification Suite running on arm64-based
ThunderX2 processors. This system is used to simulate
and verify microprocessor system designs.

From the news release:

SAN JOSE, Calif., 16 Oct 2018: Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:
CDNS) today announced that the Cadence® Verification Suite is now
enabled for Arm®-based high-performance computing (HPC) server
environments. Through an industry ecosystem collaboration, software
tools in the Cadence Verification Suite, including Xcelium™ Parallel
Logic Simulation, run on the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Apollo
70 System, which is built using the Marvell® ThunderX2® processor
based on the Armv8-A architecture.

### UEFI on Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, 835, and 845

Zhuowei Zhang has a blog post (first in a two part
series) comparing Qualcomm Snapdragon's XBL UEFI 
bootloaders on the 3 generations of Google Pixel 
phones and a Windows 10 ARM64 tablet. He looks
at how UEFI is implemented in these chips.

> I compared UEFI bootloaders from Google Pixel XL, 2XL, 3XL, and
Lenovo Miix 630 to show how Qualcomm used the flexibility of UEFI
to support Android and Windows.

The teardown is quite complete and describes in detail
how Qualcomm manages to have a single boot loader
that boots Android or Windows. The analysis is not
yet sufficiently complete to allow further modification
to boot other operating systems (such as Linux)
on these chips.

### Kubernetes on arm64 from Ubuntu

Canonical has announced support of Kubernetes on
arm64 on Ubuntu. The distribution is known as CDK
("Canonical's Distribution of Kubernetes"). This
is offered as well as a fully-managed service.

### Fedora 29 released; running under Armbian in RK3399 VM

As promised, Fedora 29 has been released. Early reports of F29 on
arm64 are all positive.  David Tischler from MiniNodes has Fedora
29 running as a guest on an arm64 virtual machine on a Rockchip
RK3399 in an arm-on-arm configuration running under Armbian.

### Github downtime due to "split brain"

Github experienced down time on October 21. Their engineering
team has published a post-mortem describing the outage, what
caused it, and how it was mitigated. A temporary (43 second)
network outage led to a circumstance where two halves of
a distributed database were out of sync. This "split brain"
condition was carefully remedied, without loss of data. The
incident writeup is excellent reading (recommended) for anyone
contemplating management of distributed systems.

### Embedded Linux Conf and KVM forum talks

Slides from talks at the recent Embedded Linux Conference
and KVM Forum at now available. These conferences have a
number of presentations of interest to anyone doing kernel
virtualization work or wanting to understand systems
design choices at the chip and kernel level.

### iPhones are allergic to helium

A hospital reported that iPhones were failing after they
were exposed to high concentrations of helium. The fault
was traced to a MEMS oscillator in the phones which 
behaved incorrectly in helium-rich atmospheres.

### Packet at IFX

On November 28th and 29th Packet is hosting "IFX 2018" in Las Vegas.
Just a block off the strip, and in the shadow of AWS re:Invent, IFX
is an infrastructure-focused "oasis in the desert" that will bring
together leaders from the overlapping worlds of hardware, software,
and connectivity.  The event is free to attend, but please do
register in advance.  There will be private meeting spaces, a beer
garden, great Wi-FI as well as programming in the areas of 5G, edge
computing, speciality silicon and open source software.
