### Cadence support on ThunderX2

At Arm TechCon, Cadence announced support for its
Cadence Verification Suite running on arm64-based
ThunderX2 processors. This system is used to simulate
and verify microprocessor system designs.

From the news release:

SAN JOSE, Calif., 16 Oct 2018: Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:
CDNS) today announced that the Cadence® Verification Suite is now
enabled for Arm®-based high-performance computing (HPC) server
environments. Through an industry ecosystem collaboration, software
tools in the Cadence Verification Suite, including Xcelium™ Parallel
Logic Simulation, run on the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Apollo
70 System, which is built using the Marvell® ThunderX2® processor
based on the Armv8-A architecture.

### UEFI on Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, 835, and 845

Zhuowei Zhang has a blog post (first in a two part
series) comparing Qualcomm Snapdragon's XBL UEFI 
bootloaders on the 3 generations of Google Pixel 
phones and a Windows 10 ARM64 tablet. He looks
at how UEFI is implemented in these chips.

> I compared UEFI bootloaders from Google Pixel XL, 2XL, 3XL, and
Lenovo Miix 630 to show how Qualcomm used the flexibility of UEFI
to support Android and Windows.

The teardown is quite complete and describes in detail
how Qualcomm manages to have a single boot loader
that boots Android or Windows. The analysis is not
yet sufficiently complete to allow further modification
to boot other operating systems (such as Linux)
on these chips.

### Kubernetes on arm64 from Ubuntu

Canonical has announced support of Kubernetes on
arm64 on Ubuntu. The distribution is known as CDK
("Canonical's Distribution of Kubernetes"). This
is offered as well as a fully-managed service.

### Fedora 29 released; running under Armbian in RK3399 VM

As promised, Fedora 29 has been released. Early reports of F29 on
arm64 are all positive.  David Tischler from MiniNodes has Fedora
29 running as a guest on an arm64 virtual machine on a Rockchip
RK3399 in an arm-on-arm configuration running under Armbian.

### iPhones are allergic to helium

A hospital reported that iPhones were failing after they
were exposed to high concentrations of helium. The fault
was traced to a MEMS oscillator in the phones which 
behaved incorrectly in helium-rich atmospheres.
