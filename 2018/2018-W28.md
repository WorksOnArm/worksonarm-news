### Build and test for arm64 on the Works on Arm Cluster

Build and test your software for Arm systems on Packet’s 
powerful collection of data center ready Arm hardware. 
Developers get access to Arm gear to do ports, build 
proofs of concept, fine-tune performance and do one-off builds.

Once your software has matured to the point where it’s ready 
for continuous integration, contact the Works on Arm project 
for details on setting up infrastructure that keeps you 
confident that every build is a good one.

The cluster keeps track of projects through a Github
repository, and you can request resources by opening
up an issue in that repo. We host a recorded call on
Wednesdays at 1600 Eastern time, and have ongoing support
through an IRC channel #worksonarm on Freenode and also
on the Packet Community Slack.

### Cross compiling Rust for CI

Ioannis Valasakis has a short tutorial on how to
use Vagrant on your MacOS or Linux system to create
a build enviornment for cross-compiling Rust binaries
to target a Raspberry Pi. He describes installing the 
Gnu Arm toolchain for support for gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
within a Debian virtual machine. 

Jorge Aparicio (@japaric) has "rust-cross", 
"Everything you need to know about cross compiling Rust programs!"
It goes into more detail about the theory of operations
of cross-compilation for Rust.

Jorge also has a project "trust" which lets you
test your Rust crate on 5 architectures and publish 
binary releases of it for Linux, macOS and Windows.
It's a Travis CI and AppVeyor template targeted at
those online CI systems.

### LinuxKit updated to Alpine 3.8

LinuxKit, the embedded operating system for Docker's Moby
project, has been updated to be based on Alpine Linux 3.8.
This according to Github project updates posted by Linuxkit
maintainer Rolf Neugebauer.

Alpine 3.8 comes with Go 1.10, which enables LinuxKit to
more fully support containerd and other projects that
depend on that version of Go.

LinuxKit was first ported to arm64 by Dennis Chen of
Arm using resources from the Works on Arm project, and
it is the core of Docker's support for arm64.

### SWI Prolog support for arm64

SWI Prolog is a comprehensive Prolog compiler and development environment.
Since its start in 1987, SWI-Prolog development has been driven by 
the needs of real world applications. 

SWI Prolog has a rich set of features, libraries for 
constraint logic programming, multithreading, unit testing, 
GUI, interfacing to Java, ODBC and others, literate programming, 
a web server, SGML, RDF, RDFS, developer tools (including an 
IDE with a GUI debugger and GUI profiler), and extensive documentation.

Dave Curylo (@i_no_see_pound) writes that a "freshly minted 
@SWI_Prolog docker image swipl:7.7.17 adds arm64 
to the existing amd64 and arm32 support!"
