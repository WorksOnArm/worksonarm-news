### Drone Cloud CI with arm64 support

### Gigabyte motherboard for Marvell ThunderX2

David Schor from WikiChip notes that the Gigabyte H261 series
motherboards support ThunderX2 CPUs with up to 195W TDP (total dissipated
power). "Makes you wonder how high the top off-roadmap SKUs really get."

> GIGABTYE's H261 series is a 2U platform with up to 4 dual-socket ThunderX2 compute nodes that can scale up to 1024 logical processors with 4 thread SMT and can address up to 4TB of memory capacity. The chassis has multiple PCIe expansion slots and can support 12 x 3.5" drives (H261-T60) or 24 2.5" drives (H261-T61) making it an ideal solution for applications that are compute and memory intensive.
