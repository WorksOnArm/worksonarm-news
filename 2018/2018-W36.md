### ESXi on Arm (VMware)

VMware did a public demonstration of ESXi running on an Arm processor
at their VMworld show in Las Vegas on August 27, 2018. The demo 
showed off the capabilities of doing virtualization at the edge
of the network on Arm processors. As noted in The Register:

> This morning's keynote audience briefly glimpsed vSphere Client 
managing a 64-bit Arm Cortex-A72-powered host that was running 
four virtual machines. The box apparently had four logical processors, 
two network interfaces, had been up 184 days, and was using 
VMware ESXi 6.8.2 build 16864140. The hardware appears to 
be a Marvell Armada 8040-powered device, and was said to 
be within a turbine generator in a wind farm.

### GCC 8.2 for Arm

A distribution of GCC 8.2 for Arm systems is now available from Arm.
GCC 8.2 was released in July 14, 2018, and the Arm build of the
entire toolchain targeted at the Arm Cortex-A family and implementing 
the Arm A-profile architecture was released on August 31, 2018.

GCC - now the "GNU compiler collection" - incorporates C, C++, and
assembly language compilers, plus some Linaro specific processor
macros to support continuity as this is a distribution that had 
previously been produced by Linaro.

In addition, this release includes a Spectre v1 mitigation backport 
based on an upstream Free Software Foundation trunk. The release
notes say: 

> This is an initial backport of those mitigations in the GNU toolchain and should be regarded as support for prototyping and early access only. Moreover, while the backports include support for the other architectures, they are included for completeness and all issues regarding these patches must be taken up upstream in the https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla by reproducing the same with upstream FSF trunk. Arm is interested in feedback regarding these workarounds for Spectre v1. 

A description of the mitigation has been published on LWN.net (link below).

### Works on Arm cluster Birds of a Feather session at Linaro Connect, 19 September 2018

The Works on Arm cluster is run by Packet for Arm to provide test, development, and data center CI/CD resources for community projects to build on arm64. The project also includes a weekly video office hours, this weekly newsletter, and a channel on the Packet Community Slack and Freenode IRC (#worksonarm) for community discussion.

This BOF session will provide current and future users of the cluster an opportunity to discuss technical issues regarding integration, testing, Cloud Native and network workloads, and generally provide a forum for helping set the direction of the effort in the coming year.

The BOF leader, Ed Vielmetti, is director of the Works on Arm project.

The session runs from 15:00 - 15:25 on Wednesday, 19 September 2018, as part of the Linaro Connect
conference to be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada the week of 17-21 September.

### LDC, a D language compiler targeting LLVM

D is an object-oriented, imperative, multi-paradigm system programming language. 
LDC is an implementation of D that uses the LLVM language back end as a code generator.

An open issue tracks progress towards a full implementation of D
targeting arm64. A notable remaining snag includes a fully realized
implmentation of variadic arguments (va_arg), but enough of the 
compiler is working to produce a release, and there is continuous
integration and testing based on Shippable's arm64 support.

The current beta release of LDC is LDC 1.12.0-beta1 (of September 4, 2018)
and the current stable release with arm64 support is LDC 1.11.0 (of August 18, 2018).
