### ESXi on Arm (VMware)

VMware did a public demonstration of ESXi running on an Arm processor
at their VMworld show in Las Vegas on August 27, 2018. The demo 
showed off the capabilities of doing virtualization at the edge
of the network on Arm processors. As noted in The Register:

> This morning's keynote audience briefly glimpsed vSphere Client 
managing a 64-bit Arm Cortex-A72-powered host that was running 
four virtual machines. The box apparently had four logical processors, 
two network interfaces, had been up 184 days, and was using 
VMware ESXi 6.8.2 build 16864140. The hardware appears to 
be a Marvell Armada 8040-powered device, and was said to 
be within a turbine generator in a wind farm.

### GCC 8.2

A distribution of GCC 8.2 for Arm systems is now available from Arm.
GCC 8.2 was released in July 14, 2018, and the Arm build of the
entire toolchain targeted at the Arm Cortex-A family and implementing 
the Arm A-profile architecture was released on August 31, 2018.

GCC - now the "GNU compiler collection" - incorporates C, C++, and
assembly language compilers, plus some Linaro specific processor
macros to support continuity as this is a distribution that had 
previously been produced by Linaro.

In addition, this release includes a Spectre v1 mitigation backport 
based on an upstream Free Software Foundation trunk. The release
notes say: 

> This is an initial backport of those mitigations in the GNU toolchain and should be regarded as support for prototyping and early access only. Moreover, while the backports include support for the other architectures, they are included for completeness and all issues regarding these patches must be taken up upstream in the https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla by reproducing the same with upstream FSF trunk. Arm is interested in feedback regarding these workarounds for Spectre v1. 

A description of the mitigation has been published on LWN.net (link below).
