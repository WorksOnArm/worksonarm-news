### Kubernetes Cluster on Pine64 (Carlos Eduardo)

Carlos Eduardo has an extended writeup on the design choices
he made in building a Kubernetes cluster from 64-bit Arm 
single-board computers. He picked the Rock64 over the Raspberry Pi
for memory and performance reasons.

"I ended up choosing the Rock64 SBC from Pine64, a quad-core A53
ARM board that can run 64bit Linux, 4GB RAM and a eMMC connector
to use this kind of memory instead of the slow-as-molasses SDCards
used on the Pi."

The software side of the build uses Kubernetes 1.9.3, Weave as the
overlay network, MetalLB as a load balancer, Traefik as an ingress
controller, and DNS provided by DD-WRT on his Netgear router.

All of the scripts and manifests needed to do this build are
available for inspection or to run yourself via Carlos's Github
repository. The writeup is quite good, detailing a set of design
choices and adapting all of the necessary software for 64-bit Arm use.

### Neutis, quad-core system on module from Emlid (Embedded World)

The Neutis is a quad-core A53 system on module from Emlid to be
debuted at next week's Embedded World. It is based on the Allwinner
H5, with a mainline Linux kernel available. For $49 (Q1) you get
8GB of eMMC storage, 512MB of DDR3 RAM, Wifi and Bluetooth, and
support for Yocto and Debian. The module is designed for embedded
use and has an extended temperature range. 

The Allwinner H5 is also found in the FriendlyARM NanoPI NEO 2
and the Orange Pi Zero Plus 2 H5.

A development kit is planned which will bring out all interfaces
to full-sized connectors for ease of prototyping.

Emlid’s booth (3A-545) at Embedded World 2018 will have more information.

### 4.15.4 kernel with Spectre/Meltdown mitigation (via Peter Robinson, Fedora)

Peter Robinson notes via Twitter that the Linux 4.15.4 kernel is
available now with Spectre and Meltdown mitigation for arm64.

### Deploying Ceph with Rook.io on arm64 (Alexandre Marangone)

Alexandre Marangone (_alram) has built an arm64 cluster of single-board
computers to test the Ceph file system. He reports: "That was fast.
Ceph deployed in minutes on ARM64 SBCs using http://rook.io" Look
for a full writeup to follow.

### Hatch, Qualcomm at Mobile World Congress

Venturebeat reports on Hatch's plans to live-stream games from
Qualcomm's Centriq 2400 64-bit Arm systems. "Games on Hatch live
in the cloud, so playing is instant — with no downloads, updates,
or in-app purchases." To pull this off they need a fast and
efficient processor in the cloud, plus a low-latency network
to allow for streaming.

Hatch will show off these systems at Qualcomm’s booth at the Mobile World
Congress event in Barcelona from February 26 to March 1.

### DockCross, a cross-building system with Docker from Kitware

DockCross is a set of Docker containers that allow cross-development
of C++ applications for a number of target platforms including arm64.
It was developed by Kitware, and presented to the Triangle (NC) C++
Developers Group by Matt McCormick, PhD in November 2016.

### High-density DOME server

A team led by Ronald P. Luijten is working on a water-cooled, high density
computing system known as DOME. This densely packed server array is based
on a design originally developed at IBM Zurich, and one prototype packs
768 cores into a single sled. The cooling technique provides hot water
as a byproduct.

"The LS2088AZMS has eight A72 ARMv8 (ie. 64-bit) cores  running at
2GHz and 32GB memory; six 10GbE, 2 SATA and 8 lanes PCIe interfaces",
writes Luijten.

### Linaro "system on module" standardization

Linaro announced in December that they were working on standardization
of a form factor and pinout for a "system on module" configuration.
Typically these SoM devices have come in a different design for each
generation of vendor parts; the standardization goal is to come up 
with a common design that would allow for reuse of a carrier module
to break out the dense pinouts into a form factor more suitable for
prototyping.
