### Can bugs be useful? Some famous bugs. (John Gall)

> The very word "Bug" suggests something worthless if not actually
repulsive, something suitable only to be eliminated. Yet every Bug, no
matter how humble, gives us at least one important piece of
information; namely, it tells us one more way our System can fail.
Since success is largely a matter of Avoiding the Most Likely Ways to
Fail, and since every Bug advances us significantly along that path, we
may hearken back to the advice given in the preface and urge the following
Policy: CHERISH YOUR BUGS. STUDY THEM.

### Kubecon news (Dan Kohn, CNCF)

4000 people are at the CNCF Kubernetes conference, Kubecon, in Austin TX with
a rare December snowstorm. Among the most controversial items
that have come to my attention there is how to pronounce `kubectl`. Lots of
demos and lots of news of 1.0 releases; when I get a summary next week I'll
fill in Arm news specifically.

The keynote addresses have been live streamed, and the plan according to 
CNCF executive director Dan Kohn is to have video of all of the
breakout sessions edited and online for viewing within three weeks.

### Qualcomm demo at Kubecon (Elsie Wahlig, Qualcomm via Jock Reed)

Packet and Qualcomm have a demo running at Kubecon using
Alexa and OpenFaaS. The technology stack includes Ubuntu 16.04 LTS,
Docker and Docker Swarm, and OpenFaaS serving up slides and 
executing functions based on voice commands - all running on
a 64-bit Armv8 Qualcomm Centriq 2400 processor hosted at Packet.
The video linked to below shows Elsie Wahlig of Qualcomm demoing the system.

Alex Ellis's OpenFaaS project is well represented at Kubecon,
with its "colorisebot" featured. See Alex at the event for
stickers and magnets and other clever swag.

### InfoSiftr demo: multiarch containers at Kubecon (Tianon Gravi, InfoSiftr)

> “This demo showcases the power of Docker’s multi-architecture
support,” says Tianon Gravi, InfoSiftr’s SVP of Operations. “Assuming
you’ve built your images correctly, and set up your Dockerfile
correctly, Docker’s multi-architecture support allows you to run
your image the same way on any architecture.”

### Oracle Linux for arm64 (Avi Miller, Oracle)

Oracle Linux for arm64 is a straight up port of RHEL, using the `yum` package manager. There is a
port of the `epel` package library as well.

> Oracle Linux 7 update 3 is the first public release of Oracle
Linux on the ARM platform and is made available as a developer
release for the benefit of developers and partners. Oracle does not
offer support for Oracle Linux 7 Update 3 (ARM).

### FreeBSD and Linux IPv6 checksum offload on Cavium ThunderX bug fix (Scott Burns, Packet)

Scott Burns of Packet led the debugging effort that resulted in a patch
that fixed IPv6 on Cavium ThunderX on Linux. A checksum had been offloaded
into hardware, and the code was correct for IPv4 but not for IPv6. 

Independently, the FreeBSD team had also introduced and corrected this bug.

### php 7.x gettype(-1) incorrect inline assembly bug fix (XXX)

If you build PHP 7.x with clang on arm64, you may run into this bug:

> "php -r "echo gettype(-1);" should return "integer", instead
returns "double". Interesting that it doesn't occur when PHP is
built with gcc, but on further digging seems it may actually be a
PHP bug & fixed in 7.2" - from @triblchikn

This has been noted and fixed in FreeBSD, termux, and Alpine. There
should be a way to eradicate this bug entirely by opening issues
for any container operating system and since the test is very simple
it might be entirely automated. The bug is referred to as
"Fix ZEND_SIGNED_MULTIPLY_LONG for AArch64" in the PHP source tree.

### FreeBSD ports. 22747 of 27655 packages work on arm64. (Ed Maste, FreeBSD Foundation)

On the Works on Arm weekly call, Ed Maste (FreeBSD Foundation) and your
reporter discussed the progress of FreeBSD's ports collection on arm64.
22747 of the 27655 packages build on arm64, and efforts are underway to 
identify common dependencies of the remaining packages to figure out
how to get closer to a perfect score for the forthcoming FreeBSD 12 release.

One of the packages that doesn't build in the current build environment is
LLVM 5.0 - not because it doesn't work, but because the build times out.

### Adopt OpenJDK project plus FreeBSD Foundation (George Adams, IBM and Ed Maste, FreeBSD Foundation)

George Adams (IBM UK and Adopt OpenJDK) and Ed Maste (FreeBSD Foundation)
have been discussing ways to bring a release of OpenJDK to the FreeBSD
operating system through the Adopt OpenJDK process.

### Ceph charms for Juju for Ubuntu (via Jeff Underhill, Arm)

The 17.11 OpenStack Charm release bundles for Ceph and OpenStack
are now available from Canonical for Ubuntu Linux. These have been
tested and validated on Arm. This is a great milestone for Arm as
all major blockers inhibiting a market ready deployment of OpenStack
and Ceph on Arm are now addressed!
