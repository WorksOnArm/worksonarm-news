### Works on Arm at Open Source Summit, Los Angeles

Your editor will be at the Open Source Summit in Los Angeles
the week of September 11-14, 2017. Packet will have a booth,
and I'll be across the show floor at the Arm Holdings booth,
demonstrating a new Works on Arm website.

### Electron port to arm64

Electron is a development tool that allow you to build cross platform
desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  It is based on Node.js
and Chromium and is used by the Atom editor and many other apps.

As of version v1.8.0 beta, arm64 builds are available for Electron.
Thanks to Hamid Zamani (HAMIDx9) for the port, which has been tested
successfully on the 64-bit Odroid C2. Note: This is a beta release.
This is the first release running on upgraded versions of
Chrome/Node.js/V8 and most likely will have have some instability
and/or regressions.

### LLVM 5.0.0 is out

The LLVM compiler is out in a version 5.0.0 release.
LLVM implments the Clang compiler for C, C++, and Objective C.

The release notes suggest improvements to code generation on aarch64
targets, with resulting speedups for code making use of AArch64 AES
crypto instructions. 

If anyone has public benchmarks showing AES performance between LLVM 5.0.0
and previous versions please share! The comments in the codebase
suggest a 40% speedup on private proprietary microbenchmarks
for this feature for this release.

* Downloads: http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#5.0.0

### SLES 12 SP3 it out

SLES (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server) 12 SP3 is out from SUSE.
This new release of August 30, 2017 is part of a 13-year lifecycle
for the platform, with 10 years of General Support and 3 years
of Extended Support.

The release contains new support for the following platforms:

* AppliedMicro X-Gene 3
* Cavium ThunderX2 CN99xx
* HiSilicon Hi1616
* Marvell Armada 7K/8K
* Qualcomm Centriq 2400 series
* Rockchip RK3399

The release notes also give details about firmware upgrades
required to support AppliedMicro X-Gene platforms.

I'm not personally running SLES 12 anywhere; first-hand reports
from the field would be welcomed.

### QEMU on GICv3 machines

From this morning's inbox -

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.
The latest release is 2.9.1 as of September 7, 2017; there is also
a 2.10.0 version updated on August 30, 2017. QEMU provides both
emulation (so that you can run binaries of one architecture on another)
as well as virtualization (so that you can run a virtual machine on
your host).

GICv3 is the third version of the Generic Interrupt Controller Architecture 
from Arm. It specifies how to configure an interrupt
controller in a bare metal environment, such as one might
need to do for running a machine emulator and virtualizer.

If you are running QEMU on Cavium hardware you may find this error
message
```
KVM_SET_DEVICE_ATTR failed: No such device
```
when launching LinuxKit or more generally when launching QEMU.

If so, then please review the following reports which provide detail
about this issue:

* https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/issues/2360
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1375571#c6

and explore the use of the flag `-machine virt,gic_version=3` when
running QEMU on GICv3 hardware such as the Cavium ThunderX.
