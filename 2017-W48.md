### Mergers and acquisitions: Marvell to buy Cavium

Our lead story is Marvell's acquisition of Cavium. In the arm64
world, Marvell makes among other things the MACCHIATObin single-board computers, 
which are based on the quad-core Marvell ARMADA 8040. 
Cavium is perhaps better known to readers
of Works on Arm News as the manufacturer of the 96-core ThunderX and
forthcoming ThunderX2 SoC. 
The ThunderX powers Packet's Type 2A server.

> Chipmaker Marvell Technology Group Ltd (MRVL.O) said on Monday
it would buy smaller rival Cavium Inc (CAVM.O) in a deal valued at
about $6 billion, as it seeks to gain scale in a semiconductor
industry that is rapidly consolidating.

Stephen Alpher, managing editor at the financial newsletter Seeking Alpha, reports on
leadership changes at the company.

> Marvell CEO Matt Murphy will run the merged company, and Cavium
CEO Syed Ali will continue as strategic advisor and member of the
board.

Valentina Palladino of the trade publication Ars Technica gives some background.

> Bermuda-based Marvell makes semiconductors for data-storage devices
while California-based Cavium produces communications and networking
chips. The deal better positions Marvell to compete with bigger
rivals, including Intel and Broadcom, in a semiconductor industry
that has changed a lot over the past couple years as companies buy
out rivals.

The response from analyst Paul Teach at Tirias Research in Forbes is to wonder if the
transaction undervalues Cavium's shares, based on the upside from
Cavium's new supercomputer-ready ThunderX2.

> Cray showed its high-end XC50 supercomputer board containing four
two-socket Cavium server nodes (eight processors in all). Cray’s
endorsement of the ARMv8 instruction set via Cavium’s ThunderX2
processor is a watershed event for the Arm server field in general
and specifically for Cavium. I think it credibly moves Arm way past
the “is it performant in servers” question. I never imagined that
I would use the words “Cray” and “Arm” in the same sentence.

Ed Maste, Director of Project Development at the FreeBSD Foundation,
spoke to Ed Vielmetti, Special Projects Director at Packet
on the Wednesday morning Works on Arm conference call. 
(Us Eds have to stick together.)

His main concern regarding this acquisition was the difficulty of getting
his "millennial developers" access to documentation from both Cavium
and Marvell. There was no concern about the quality of the docs,
but access is difficult, gated behind layers of sales process and
non-disclosure agreements. Maste said he and Packet's Zak Smith
"hammered" the Cavium product manager on this issue
at the latest Cavium sales conference, and hoped that the
merged company would have more of an open culture when it
came to sharing data sheets and detailed docs.

### Performance: Go crypto library on arm64

The slow performance of Go crypto libraries on arm64 was first reported here in 
in issue 2017-W46 based on a benchmark analysis by Cloudflare done for the Qualcomm
Centriq 2400 product launch. In response, engineers from Cloudflare and Arm
are cooperating to fix these issues.

Specifically, the work is to be done to address performance issues 
in the Go crypto libraries, which to date have been extensively optimized for x86
processors but not yet for arm64. The algorithms in the Go
librares crypto/ecsda, crypto/rsa, crypto/aes, and crypto/chacha20poly1305
are targeted for improvement.

The Go source tree had a feature freeze for Go 1.10 on November 1, 2017, 
which means that the earliest that these issues will be addressed is
likely to be in Go 1.11.

### Bug fixes: FreeBSD IPv6 and VNIC support on ThunderX

Ed Maste from the FreeBSD Foundation reports that the FreeBSD-12
testing version that's available on Packet's Type 2A server now
has IPv6 support after a number of bugs were fixed in the vnic driver
for the ThunderX's integrated 10/40G Ethernet interfaces.

### Bug fixes: QEMU 2.11 support for Java

Stuart Monteith from Linaro reports on the #worksonarm IRC channel
on Freenode that a bug that prevented the QEMU qemu-aarch64 system
emulator from running the "Hello World" test program has been fixed
by Linaro's Peter Maydell.  The patch can be tested now, and ought
to be available in the QEMU 2.11 release. The problem was reported
here in Works on Arm News 2017-W41.
