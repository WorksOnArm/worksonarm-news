### Mergers and acquisitions: Marvell to buy Cavium

Our lead story is Marvell's acquisition of Cavium. In the arm64
world, Marvell makes among other things the ESPRESSObin and
MACCHIATObin single-board computers, which are based on the
CORE COUNT CHIP TYPE SOC. Cavium is perhaps better known to readers
of Works on Arm News as the manufacturer of the ThunderX and
forthcoming ThunderX2 SOC. The ThunderX powers Packet's Type 2A server.

> Chipmaker Marvell Technology Group Ltd (MRVL.O) said on Monday
it would buy smaller rival Cavium Inc (CAVM.O) in a deal valued at
about $6 billion, as it seeks to gain scale in a semiconductor
industry that is rapidly consolidating.

Stephen Alpher, TITLE at the newsletter Seeking Alpha, reports on
leadership changes at the company.

> Marvell CEO Matt Murphy will run the merged company, and Cavium
CEO Syed Ali will continue as strategic advisor and member of the
board.

> Bermuda-based Marvell makes semiconductors for data-storage devices
while California-based Cavium produces communications and networking
chips. The deal better positions Marvell to compete with bigger
rivals, including Intel and Broadcom, in a semiconductor industry
that has changed a lot over the past couple years as companies buy
out rivals.

ANALYST RESPONSE TIRIAS RESEARCH IS CAVIUM UNDERVALUED

> Cray showed its high-end XC50 supercomputer board containing four
two-socket Cavium server nodes (eight processors in all). Cray’s
endorsement of the ARMv8 instruction set via Cavium’s ThunderX2
processor is a watershed event for the Arm server field in general
and specifically for Cavium. I think it credibly moves Arm way past
the “is it performant in servers” question. I never imagined that
I would use the words “Cray” and “Arm” in the same sentence.

Ed Maste, at Director of Project Development at the FreeBSD Foundation,
spoke to Ed Vielmetti, Special Projects Director at Packet
on the Wednesday morning Works on Arm conference call. 
(Us Eds have to stick together.)
His main concern regarding this acquisition was the difficulty of getting
his "millenial developers" access to documentation from both Cavium
and Marvell. There was no concern about the quality of the docs,
but access is difficult, gated behind layers of sales process and
non-disclosure agreements. Maste said he 
"hammered" the Cavium product manager on this issue
at the latest Cavium sales conference, and hoped that the
merged company would have more of an open culture when it
camed to sharing data sheets and detailed docs.

### Performance: Go crypto library on arm64

The slow performance of Go crypto libraries on arm64 was first reported here in 
in issue 2017-W46 based on a benchmark analysis by Cloudflare done for the Qualcomm
Centriq 2400 product launch. In response, engineers from Cloudflare and Arm
are cooperating to fix these issues.

Specifically, the work is to be done to address performance issues 
in the Go crypto libraries, which to date have been extensively optimized for x86
processors but not yet for arm64. The algorithms in the Go
LIBRARY/NAME are targetted for improvement.

### Bug fixes: FreeBSD IPv6 and VNIC support on ThunderX

Ed Maste from the FreeBSD Foundation reports that the FreeBSD-12
testing version that's available on Packet's Type 2A server now
has IPv6 support and support for DESCRIBE VNIC.

### Bug fixes: QEMU support for Java

Stuart Monteith from Linaro reports on the #worksonarm IRC channel
on Freenode that a bug that prevented the QEMU qemu-aarch64 system
emulator from running the "Hello World" test program has been fixed
by Linaro's Peter Maydell.  The patch can be tested now, and ought
to be available in the QEMU 2.11 release. The problem was reported
here in Works on Arm News 2017-W41.
