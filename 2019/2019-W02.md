### Samsung Exynos Auto chip, in Audi infotainment system

Samsung Electronics has announced that their Auto Eyxnos V9 chip will power
the in-vehicle infotainment system on the next generation of Audi cars.
The chip is built on an 8 nanometer process, and features eight
of Arm's A76 cores running at up to 2.1 GHz, plus a "safety island"
core to the automotive ASIL-B standard and a Mali G76 GPU and a
neural processing unit.

### Johnny Mkhael cluster

Johnny Mkhael is buildng a bare-metal ARM cluster designed to run
Kubernetes and OpenFasS, backed by a RAID1 SSD and with a dedicated touch screen.
He is using Alex Ellis's "k8s on Raspbian" repository to guide
the build, which is the basis for his "Build your own bare-metal ARM cluster"
blog post.

### Pi Zero telescope control from Dane Gardner

Hackaday features Dane Gardner's design for a Raspberry Pi Zero based
remote control telescope. The system features 
remote computer control of a Celestron telescope mount.
The Kstars open source astronomy software is combined with
the INDI open library for telescope controls to make a powerful,
affordable system. The Pi Zero is embedded
inside the scope's control handset, and can be controlled
over Bluetooth with a suitable game controller.

Gardner's approach does not completely
depend on the computer system for use, so you can still
haul out your scope into the field for direct observations
when the automation is turned off.

### Powershell for arm64 on Windows and Linux

PowerShell Core is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS) automation and configuration tool/framework that works well with your existing tools and is optimized for dealing with structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST APIs, and object models. It includes a command-line shell, an associated scripting language and a framework for processing cmdlets. 

PowerShell 6.2.0 preview 3 features experimental support
for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows on Arm as well as Linux 
support for both 32-bit and 64-bit Arm systems.
