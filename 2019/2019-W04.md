### MiniNodes 5-Node Pi 3 CoM Carrier Board, version 2

David Tischler of MiniNodes has produced a second spin
of his 5-node Pi 3 Compute Module carrier board. The latest
edition adds LEDs and serial ports to each module for
improved debugging and visual monitoring. The carrier
board incorporates an Ethernet switch and a single power
jack to power all the modules. MiniNodes produced this
project with the help of Gumstix and from Arm.

### k3s ("kates"), a minimalist version of Kubernetes ("k8s").

k3s ("5 less than k8s") is a lightweight and minimalist
version of Kubernetes. It consumes half the memory of
regular Kubernetes and fits into applications for edge,
IoT, CI, and "situations where a PhD in k8s clusterology
is infeasible". A lot of things have been removed, and
hopefully you won't notice.

k3s is a project from Darren Shepherd of Rancher, and 
some things you'd really want to have work in a production
environment are not complete yet. Alex Ellis of VMware
and the OpenFaaS project reports that he's able to run
OpenFaaS on k3s, and that the bootstrap process involves
only downloading a single binary on an untouched Ubuntu VM.

### Marshall Brekka "Home Kubernetes Cluster" build.

Marshall Brekka has a nice home Kubernetes cluster build, featuring
a control plane running on a Banana Pi M1, with its dual-core 1 Ghz
CPU.  Several default settings had to be adjusted for the Banana
Pi as the TLS encryption routines on that device are sufficiently
slow that they cause timeouts.

A faster quad-core A53 ROC-RK3328-CC board in the same cluster does
not require adjustments since it's fast enough to get the crypto
done in time.

## Operating systems

### Armbian on A20

Olimex has released a new image for their Allwinner A20
based single-board computers, including the A20-OLinuXuno-LIME,
A20-OLinuxUno-MICRO, and A20-SOM and A20-SOM204 systems. The
image is based on Armbian with OLinuXuno specific features,
and the software recognizes the feature of the numerous
variants of A20-based systems they have released and
auto-detects a configuration.

The A20 (sun7i) is a dual-core Cortex-A7 system-on-chip design, integrating a Mali400
GPU.

## Performance

### memory walls 

Memory performance is limited by hardware architecture, and
the Memory Walls project looks to improve memory performance
by trading off some CPU utilization for better effective
memory bandwidth.
