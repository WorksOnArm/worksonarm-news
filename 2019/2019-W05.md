## Performance

### Memory Walls 

Memory performance is limited by hardware architecture, and the
Memory Walls project looks to improve memory performance by trading
off some CPU utilization for better effective memory bandwidth.
Francesc Alted takes on benchmarking several Arm systems including
the Marvell ThunderX2 and the Huawei Kirin 980.

## Graphics

### Panfrost 

Panfrost is a set of free and open source drivers for Mali Txxxx
and Gxxx GPUs (Midgard and Bifrost). These drivers are
reverse engineered from tracing Armâ€™s userspace 3D
drivers and the open source kernel driver from Arm.
Install instructions require compiling out-of-tree kernel code.

## Retrocomputing

### PiPDP-8, emulator

The PiDP-8/I is a modern replica of the 1968 PDP-8/I computer,
complete with a front panel with blinking lights. A Raspberry
Pi drives the system, and if you have a quad-core Pi 3B you can
set a few of the cores to work an incandescent light simulator
so that the blinking lights appear to glow faithfully.

### Apple II video card with arm64 SoC 

John Brooks from Blue Shift Incorporated has designed a high-performance
video card for the Apple II family. The HDMI output of the VidHD
is driven by a quad-core arm64 processor, which is slaved to the
Apple II bus. A full set of manuals and specifications is available
from Call-A.P.P.L.E, the web site of the Apple Pugetsound Program
Library Exchange.
