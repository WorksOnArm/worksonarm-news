### Grafana with new arm64 Docker support

Grafana is a popular open-source visualization tool
that is used to analyze log data on top of a
variety of data stores. 

Johannes Würbach has contributed code to Grafana 
that now builds multiarch containers that
include both x86 and Arm support. This is available with 
the v5.4.3 release of 2019-01-14.

### P^3MA call for papers; Frankfurt, Germany, June 20, 2019

The 4th International Workshop on Performance Portable Programming 
models for Manycore or Accelerators (P^3MA) has issued their Call 
for Papers. Held in conjunction with ISC 2019, This workshop will 
provide a forum to bring together researchers and developers to 
discuss community’s proposals and solutions to performance portability.

Performance portable approaches and implementations are becoming 
increasingly crucial for the application developers to make the 
best use of modern HPC architectures. With diverging architectural 
designs, it can be a challenge to develop high-level abstractions 
that can expose all the rich features of the hardware to the programmer, 
especially with the introduction of heterogeneous architectures.

Submissions are due April 3, 2019; the workshop is held in Frankfurt,
Germany on June 20, 2019 as part of ISC 2019.

## Operating Systems

### SUSE Server for Arm 

SUSE has announced general availability of SUSE Linux Enterprise
Server (SLES) for Arm. "Previously, SUSE subscriptions for the 
Arm hardware platforms were only available to SUSE Partners", noted
Jay Kruemcke, product manager at SUSE, in a blog post of 14 January 2019.
"We are now ready to sell subscriptions directly to customers."

Pricing for SLES for Arm is based on a hybrid model, with 
smaller SoCs being priced on a per-core basis in units of
4 cores, and larger SoCs with greater than 16 cores per
socket being charged on a per-socket basis.

Supported SoCs include:

* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Opteron A1100
* Ampere Computing X-Gene 1, X-Gene 2, eMag
* Broadcom BCM2837 (Raspberry Pi 3 B and 3 B+)
* Cavium ThunderX, ThunderX2 CN99xx, Octeon TX
* HiSilicon Hi1616
* NXP QorIQ LS2085A / LS2045A, LS2080A / LS2040A, LS1043A
* Marvell Armada 7040/8040
* Rockchip RK3399
* Qualcomm Centriq 2400
* Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC
