### Spectre and Meltdown

Spectre and Meltdown are the names of two families of exploits
that introduce novel side-channel attacks on the speculative
execution pathways of nearly all modern CPUs.

Specific to Arm, there are two documents to look at, the security update entitled
"Vulnerability of Speculative Processors to Cache Timing Side-Channel Mechanism",
and the "Cache Speculation Side-Channels" white paper.

News is still coming out about these issues, some of which are known
to affect Arm-based systems. Rather than providing expert advice
here, I'll defer to this list of vendor-provided explanations
and mitigation tools maintained by Hanno Böck:

### bcc, Tools for BPF-based Linux IO analysis, networking, monitoring

bcc is a set of tools that use the Linux eBPF (extended Berkeley
Packet Filters) for kernel tracing, process handling,
disk and network performance analysis.

* https://www.iovisor.org/technology/bcc

The build process for bcc on arm64 depends on the latest versions
of CLang and LuaJIT. If you are doing benchmarking or other
performance analysis it's worth the trouble to get it installed.

### CLang 6.0.0

CLang 6.0.0 will be the latest C compiler from the LLVM project.
The release schedule for LLVM is as follows:

* Jan 3 - Branch point, "slow start"
* Jan 17 - RC1
* Feb 7 - RC2
* Feb 21 - Final

bcc for arm64 depends on the latest CLang, and to build bcc
from source you'll also need to build CLang from source as
there are not binary releases for arm64 for development versions
of that compiler.

* http://llvm.org/

One of the LLVM tools that is notably improved over its GNU
counterpart is `lld`, the LLVM linker. If you watch compiles
of very large programs on multi-core machines you'll often be
waiting not for compiles but for the link step. `lld` will
use multiple cores when available and advertises a 2x speedup
over the GNU `gold` linker.

* http://lld.llvm.org/

While `lld` is designed to be a drop-in compatible replacement
for the GNU linkers, there are always bound to be issues found
during development. The FreeBSD project is targeting lld as its
system linker in the upcoming FreeBSD 12 release.

### LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3

Another dependency for `bcc` is the latest beta release of LuaJIT,
a just-in-time compiler for the `lua` language. 

* http://luajit.org/

The release dates from May 2017, and advertises the following:

> This is the third beta release for the new v2.1 branch. Apart from various fixes, the major new features are JIT compiler support for x64 in GC64 mode, ARM64 and MIPS64.

LuaJIT is on a relatively slow release cycle; 2.1.0-beta3 follows
2.1.0-beta2 by about a year. The Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) will have
this new beta3 as its default version; until then, you can install
from source.

### Repology, for tracking releases across repositories

One of the ways to assess how up-to-date a given repository is
to the latest and greatest releases of software is to use a tool
like Repology.

* http://repology.org

This system scoops up and analyzes repository information across
a few dozen package managers and provides consolidated information
about package versions and contact information. The nice color-coded
report lets you pick out at a glance which distributions have 
up-to-date packages for software of interest.

### Single board computer roundup from LinuxGizmos

Twice a year, LinuxGizmos does a review of Linux-friendly single board
computers that are currently on the market. The January 2018 report
lists 103 devices, ranging from the market-leading Raspberry Pi 3 
($35) to the tiny 56 x 35 x 5mm PocketBeagle ($25) to dozens of other
boards featuring SoCs from Allwinner, Qualcomm, TI Sitara, Rockchip,
HiSilicon, NXP, Mediatek, Samsung, Intel, and more.

A typical review lists not only speeds and feeds, but also an indication of
how popular and how vigorous community support is for each of these devices.
