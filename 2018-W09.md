### Cavium and Sprint Collaborate for NFV Testing on Packet's Public Cloud

At Mobile World Congress, Sprint and Cavium worked together to
show a network function virtualiztion (NFV) demo on Cavium 
ThunderX2 hardware running in Packet's public cloud.

### OpenStack Queens on ARM64

Gema Gomez of Linaro writes about bringing up the Queens release of
OpenStack on arm64. OpenStack provides a system execution
environment based on virtual machines, with governance
for the project organized by the OpenStack Foundation.

> Queens is the first release that we feel confident will run out
of the box on ARM64, a milestone of collaboration not only from the
Linaro member companies but also from the OpenStack community at
large. OpenStack projects have been welcoming of the diversity and
inclusive, helping us ramp up: either giving direction and reviewing
our code or fixing issues themselves.

### 3d-printed case with power readout for Rock64

Jim put together a design to share for a 3d-printed
case with a power supply and a readout for system
voltage on the front. 

> A case for the Rock64 and a 2.5" drive. The drive sits in the
bottom section, the Rock64 goes on the mounting plate and the lid
has mounts for a pair of buck converters and a fan. Normal use is
probably to skip the buck converters and use the standard power
supply, but I have a tendency to over-engineer things.

### Allwinner VPU Linux support update

Maxime Ripard from Bootlin (formerly Free Electrons) has successfully funded
a Kickstarter campaign for upstream support for video drivers
for the Allwinner VPU.  The goal is to reverse engineer this system
and put drivers into the mainline Linux kernel. 

As a result of this funding, Paul Kocialkowski has been hired on
as an intern to work on this code. The Kickstarter campaign 
continues with stretch goals to add additional codecs and support
more platforms.

### Open Source ARM OpenGL drivers for Mali

Qiang Yu (yuq) is working on open source drivers for the ARM Mali 400/450
GPUs to support OpenGL.

### MariaDB on arm64 for Qualcomm

Since the announcement of MariaDB on arm64 for the Qualcomm
platform in November, developers have been working on 
performance tuning for that platform to optimize write
operations.

Sandeep Sethia from Qualcomm discussed the port and optimization
at the MariaDB Developers Unconference, February 24-25, 2018
in New York City, with slides available.

> We are pleased to announce a number of performance improvements
that are being made available in the recently shipped 10.3 release
candidate 10.3.4.  By leveraging the highly parallelized 48-core
Qualcomm Centriq 2400 processor running at 2.6GHz with 6 memory
channels in a fully coherent ring architecture, our interest is to
extract write performance optimization in a single row write use
case for a highly threaded application.

### HP Envy X2 Windows laptop powered by Qualcomm

HP is taking pre-orders for the Envy X2 laptop, one of
the first Windows devices powered by Qualcomm's
Snapdragon 835 arm64 processor.
