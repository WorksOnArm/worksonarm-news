### Single board computer: Pine H64 (Allwinner H6)

The Pine H64 is one in the latest of a line of increasingly powerful
single-board computers that have the form factor of
the popular Raspberry Pi but that replace the Pi's
system-on-chip with a more capable central processing
unit.

The Pine H64 is built around the Allwinner H6, a quad-core
A53 running at 1.488 Ghz. The main board can hold up to
3 GB of memory, and there's  
storage support for built-in 128Mb SPI Flash memory, 
a bootable eMMC module, bootable microSD Cards or USB attached storage.
The Linux kernel 4.9 has support for the device.
Availability starts January 31 with the 3 GB unit listing
at $45.

Tech Republic has a generally positive announcement of
the device, but cautions the first-time user as follows:

> One thing to bear in mind is that most rival single-board 
computers are at somewhat of a disadvantage compared to the
[Raspberry] Pi range, lacking their breadth of stable software, 
tutorials and community support.

The Armbian forums have discussion of other H6 based
systems including the Orange Pi One Plus.
