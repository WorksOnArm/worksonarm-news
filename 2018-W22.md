### Arm announces Cortex-A76

Arm Holdings announced their new Cortex-A76 processor core, which
is expected to show up in system designs in 2019.  The new chip is
described as targeting the laptop market. Clock speeds for the
design approach 3 Ghz on a 7 nm process, and performance is described
as 2x that of the current Cortex-A73.

Anandtech has perhaps the most detailed report on the A76,
pointing out its origins in the Austin, TX design facility
and noting detailed breakdowns of power and performance.

> The Cortex A76 microarchitecture has been designed with high
performance while maintaining power efficiency in mind. Starting
from a clean sheet allowed the designers to remove bottlenecks
throughout the design and to break previous microarchitectural
limitations. The focus here was again maximum performance while
remaining within energy efficiency that is fit for smartphones.

### Running 32-bit Arm code on the A76

The new A76 diverges from previous processor core designs
delivered by Arm in its primary support for 64-bit operations.
32-bit aarch32 instructions are planned to run in user mode,
but kernel and supervisor codes are solely 64-bit. The
Register focuses on this architectural element of the design.

The move away from 32-bit code is not without precedent,
as server-class designs from Qualcomm and Cavium already
ship without any 32-bit support.

### Interview: "The Future of Arm with Nandan Nayampally"

Nandan Nayampally is VP and General Manager of the Client
Line of Business at Arm.`

> In this episode Ryan [Shrout] and Patrick [Moorhead] sit down
with Arm VP and GM of Client Business Nandan Nayampally to talk
through the announcements of new high-performance cores and IP for
mobile device markets. We touch on the design decisions that went
into the new offerings and how this shift will help Arm move into
areas like Windows more aggressively.

### Windows on Arm: VLC 4.0.0 development release available

VLC is a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player and
framework that plays most multimedia files as well as DVDs, Audio
CDs, VCDs, and various streaming protocols. The latest release of
VLC includes a development release for the Windows on Arm platform,
targeting arm64 Windows systems.

### SRECon Asia: Cloudflare on arm64 in productionn

Ignat Korchagin of Cloudflare is on the SRECon Asia 
schedule on Wednesday, June 6, 2018 for the talk
"Call to ARMs: Adopting an arm64 Server into x86 Infrastructure".

### JEP 315 targets aarch64 intrinsics for JDK 11

The "JEP 315" proposal plans improve the existing string and array
intrinsics, and implement new intrinsics for the java.lang.Math
sin, cos and log functions, on AArch64 processors. The work
targets JDK 11.

### TurrisMOX arm64 router on Indiegogo

Powered by a Marvell Armada 3720 1.2 GHz dual core CPU,
the TurrisMOX router is designed as a configurable,
expandable system.

### Kubernetes on Orange Pi (Tobias Bruner)

Tobias Bruner gives a detailed breakdown of the build
of his new Kubernetes cluster based on the Orange Pi WinPlus
board, an A64 Quad-core Cortex-A53 64bit system with 2GB
of memory. His build leverages the previous work of
Chris Short's Ansible-based "rak8s" which performs
the bootstrap process.

> The cluster got a name: APPUiOli. It's first public exposure was
at the DevOpsDays conference in ZÃ¼rich-Winterthur. We deployed
podstalk to the cluster and offered a public URL via ngrok so
everyone could connect to the cluster. On a big screen we displayed
the Grafana dashboard.

The deployment is based on Kubernetes 1.9.

### GNOME moves to new CI system on Gitlab

The GNOME desktop environment has been available for
arm64 systems through distributions for some time.
For GNOME 3.30 the project has integrated arm64 CI/CD
builds into its development process, which has moved to
Gitlab. After some work by Abderrahim Kitouni (@akitouni)
to update dependencies, the project now has a full
test build on arm64 whenever a change is made.
