### Helm and Tiller; Helm 3

> There are no current plans to release multi-arch images for Tiller,
though in helm 3 tiller's being removed so there won't be the need
to support multi-arch images in that case. That being said if someone
were to PR support for ARM Tiller images in our CI process we'd be
happy to throw that into the matrix.
