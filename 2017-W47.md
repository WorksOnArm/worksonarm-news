### Works on Arm Office Hours

Ed Vielmetti (Works on Arm project manager) is hosting
Works on Arm office hours online on Wednesdays. The first
event was on Wednesday, November 15, and saw participation
from Ed Maste (FreeBSD Foundation), Jacob Smith (Packet),
and Dieter Reuter (Hypriot). There is a dedicated Zoom
channel at Packet available, and chat is available 24x7
through the #worksonarm channel on Packet's Community Slack
and on Freenode's #worksonarm IRC channel.

Thanks to out to Mario Loria (Liquid Web) for showing the
way with a great telecast for the Kubernetes #office-hours
team - I'll be learning the tech from the Kubernetes team
which seems to have these real-time chat systems figured out.

### Supercomputing 2017 (SC17)

Most of the news this week is coming out of the SC17 conference
in Denver, which saw a huge amount of news related to Arm in 
high-performance computing. There was representation from
Red Hat, SUSE, Cray, HPE, IBM, Cavium, and Qualcomm.

Arm's Community weblog has a great roundup of all the news, which
is worth a look.

> If you are following the server or HPC space closely, then you
probably have seen the volume of Arm server news go well beyond 11
in the past week. Most of the news is coming straight out of our
server ecosystem which has never been more active and robust.

If you are a reporter or analyst and have any questions for Arm or
need a contact for one of our ecosystem partners, please contact
Allison PR.

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux on Arm

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is now supported on arm64 systems
with RHEL 7.4.  The initial support is expect to target new systems
from HPE.  Jon Masters, Red Hat's "Captain Arm", made the
announcement at SC17.

> Today, after 7 years of work, Red Hat formally announced Red Hat
Enterprise Linux for Arm. I am a proud father and very happy for
the entire team: we did this together, all of us. I am forever
grateful to you for your work, and to my execs for believing in
another of my crazy ideas early on.

### Debian 8 and Debian 9 on Packet's Arm based Type 2A

As part of the Works on Arm project, Packet announced
availability of Debian 8 and Debian 9 on their Cavium
ThunderX based "Type 2A" servers.

> Debian 8 (Jessie) is based on Linux 3.16, which does not support
the ThunderX SoC well. The jessie-backports repository now contains
a kernel based on Linux 4.8, which does have the necessary ThunderX
patches. It may now be possible to use Debian on Type 2A as a result.

### Hardware: Cray XC50 with Cavium ThunderX2, Cray compilers

Cray customers will have an Arm-based supercomputer with
Cray's HPC software stack and optimized compilers.
The XC50 targets scientific workloads.

> Building on Cray’s adaptive supercomputing vision, the Cray® XC®
series integrates extreme performance HPC interconnect capabilities
with best-in-class processing technologies to produce a single,
scalable architecture. Understanding that no single processor engine
is ideal for every type of user application, the Cray XC50 system
offers the addition of the 64-bit Cavium ThunderX2™ processor with
the stability and performance of the Cray Linux® Environment, as
well as a premium programming environment in a proven, scalable
infrastructure, making the XC50 system the first production Arm®
supercomputer available.

### Hardware: HPE Apollo 70 with Cavium ThunderX2

At SC17, HPE announced a ThunderX2 based HPE Apollo 70 system.

> The Apollo 70, using Cavium’s 64-bit ARMv8-A ThunderX2™ Server
Processor, is purpose-built for memory intensive HPC workloads and
delivers up to 33 percent more memory bandwidth than today’s industry
standard servers. The Apollo 70 also provides access to HPE’s
partnership ecosystem delivering key HPC components including Red
Hat® Enterprise Linux®, SUSE® Linux Enterprise Server for ARM, and
Mellanox® high-speed InfiniBand & Ethernet fabric solutions.

### Hardware: Bitscope Raspberry Pi cluster at LANL (Gary Grider)

At SC17, Bitscope showed off a 750 node Raspberry Pi cluster,
designed for Los Alamos National Labs as a development and training
system for massively parallel workloads.

> The BitScope Pi Cluster Modules system creates an affordable, scalable, highly parallel testbed for high-performance-computing system-software developers. The system comprises five rack-mounted BitScope Pi Cluster Modules consisting of 3,000 cores using Raspberry Pi ARM processor boards, fully integrated with network switching infrastructure.

LANL's press release on the topic quotes Gary Grider:

> “It’s not like you can keep a petascale machine around for R&D
work in scalable systems software,” said Gary Grider, leader of the
High Performance Computing Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory,
home of the Trinity supercomputer. “The Raspberry Pi modules let
developers figure out how to write this software and get it to work
reliably without having a dedicated testbed of the same size, which
would cost a quarter billion dollars and use 25 megawatts of
electricity.”

### Software: Ubuntu release of Docker 1.13

Canonical has released Docker 1.13 for 16.04 LTS "Xenial". Of note
is that this fixes a long-standing bug where the system
Go 1.6 version guesses wrong when choosing a page size. 

Thanks to Michael Hudson-Doyle (Canonical) and
Patricia Gaughen (Canonical) for the work necessary
to get this fix backported.

### Patch: arm64: Add software workaround for Falkor erratum 1041

A patch from Shanker Donthineni addresses an issue with
speculative fetch on the Falkor cores in Qualcomm's Centriq 2400
processor. The erratum is QCOM_FALKOR_ERRATUM_1041.

> The ARM architecture defines the memory locations that are permitted
to be accessed as the result of a speculative instruction fetch from
an exception level for which all stages of translation are disabled.
Specifically, the core is permitted to speculatively fetch from the
4KB region containing the current program counter 4K and next 4K.

### Opinion: AWS bare metal?

Jacob Smith from Packet asks whether Amazon's AWS service
will offer bare metal hosting to augment its current virtualized
services, and what that means for the hosting world.

> Other Architectures Get a Boost - While I’m not convinced that
an AWS product would let you truly touch the hardware, I think
promoting a bare metal offering exposes what’s under the hood: and
increasingly that means x86 and something else - be it Arm, AMD,
OpenPower, etc.   This will help software like Kubernetes accelerate
its early investments into knowing the hardware (e.g. device tags
for GPU’s) - helping users to extract value from a massive variety
of hardware.
