### Video: Ed Vielmetti interview by Charbax at Linaro Connect

Charbax (Nicolas Charbonnier) is a video blogger who produces
original video and news contents about ARM Powered devices, mostly
from trade shows and conferences around the world. I had
a chance to catch up with him at Linaro Connect in San Francisco
(SFO17).

> Interview with Ed Vielmetti, Special Projects Director at
http://Packet.net talking about their available and upcoming ARMv8
servers in the data center and the ARM Server ecosystem that is
being advanced at a rapid pace.

### Video: Ed Vielmetti presentation at Mesoscon

Ed was at Mesoscon in September 2017 giving this presentation
on Mesos and the Arm ecosystem. The talk predates Qualcomm's
announcement of their Centriq 2400 "Amberwing" processor and
talks through the process of porting Mesos to Arm servers.

### Video: ARM HPC Workshop at Riken AICS (Linaro)

The Arm HPC Workshop brought together the leading Arm vendors,
end users and the open source development community in Tokyo, to
discuss the latest products, developments and open source software
support. Topics included

* Compilers including GCC, LLVM, C++, Fortran, optimisations, benchmarking and general support
* OS and Runtime
* Tools
* Math Libraries
* Orchestration
* Machine Learning

Recordings and slides from the workshop sessions of December 12-13 2017
are now online.

### Nix installer for arm64 (Graham Christensen)

Nix is a purely functional package manager for Linux that was developed
as part of the NixOS operating system but that can be
run on other Linux distributions like Ubuntu or CentOS.
Its unique approach allows for reproducible builds of
packages even in the face of conflicting dependencies
within an operating system.

The Nix installer now works on arm64 (aarch64) systems
through the command line below:

> you can now `curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | bash` on aarch64 and get Nix
