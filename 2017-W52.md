### Video: Ed Vielmetti interview by Charbax at Linaro Connect

Charbax (Nicolas Charbonnier) is a video blogger who produces
original video and news contents about ARM Powered devices, mostly
from trade shows and conferences around the world. I had
a chance to catch up with him at Linaro Connect in San Francisco
(SFO17).

> Interview with Ed Vielmetti, Special Projects Director at
http://Packet.net talking about their available and upcoming ARMv8
servers in the data center and the ARM Server ecosystem that is
being advanced at a rapid pace.
