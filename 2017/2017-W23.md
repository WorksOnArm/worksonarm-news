# Works on ARM news, Issue 7, Friday June 9, 2017 (Week 23)

Works on ARM news is written and edited by Ed Vielmetti at Packet. It comes out weekly on Fridays on Twitter's @worksonarm account and via Github. Subscription details are at the bottom of this issue.

In this issue:

98 open spec hacker friendly single board computers,
Automotive Grade Linux,
ThunderX2 presentations at HPC conference,
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 + Microsoft Windows 10,
Minio on Go speedups from FOSDEM, and
Wireguard VPN with ARM speedups.

### Linux Gizmos: 98 open spec hacker friendly single board computers

[Linux Gizmos] has an excellent and long inventory of single board
computers that are friendly to hackers. Their tally of 98 systems
gives a brief technical overview of each, plus a take on how easily
the system can be booted and programmed with open source tools.
Prices range from $15 to $200, and most of the boards under review
(though not all) are ARM based.

The story of ARM-based single board computers all too often comes
down to how hard it is to boot the systems and how much of a challenge
it is to get a mainline kernel running. This inventory should be
seen both as a snapshot of the state of the art as well as a shoppers
guide to technology that might be applicable to your embedded Linux
or development board selections. A convenient [comparison spreadsheet]
published through Google Docs gives a quick summary of processor details,
GPU and memory configurations, I/O ports, and storage so that you can
zoom in quickly on the part you need.

### Automotive Grade Linux

[Automotive Grade Linux] (AGL) is a Linux-based in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) platform aimed at OEMs who are looking for an open software stack for the connected car. AGL is a complete software stack including a Yocto-based board support package, automotive specific middleware for audio management, connection management, graphics, and a full application framework with App APIs and SDK. AGL also includes extensions to support the automotive CAN and MOST bus and a full security framework to make it reliable enough to put in vehicles.

At the May 2017 Automotive Linux Summit event held in Tokyo,
Toyota announced that Automotive Grade Linux would be the 
[basis for the vehicle infotainment system] system in the
2018 Toyota Camry as well as Lexus vehicles in the future.

This IVI platform was designed from the start to work
on ARM and Intel platforms equally well. In addition to the reference
platforms from Renesas, Intel, Qualcomm, NXP, TI, the system can run 
under emulation with QEMU or on community supported platforms
including the widely available [Raspberry Pi].

AGL is an open source project hosted by The Linux Foundation.  Dan
Cauchy is Executive Director of Automotive Grade Linux. The AGL
platform is available to all, and anyone can participate in its
development.

### ThunderX2 presentations at HPC conference

Cavium, maker of the high performance ThunderX and new
ThunderX2 server-class ARM systems, will be presenting at the
[ISC High Performance] conference in Frankfurt, Germany June 18-22 2017.

[ISC High Performance]:http://isc-hpc.com/

On Tuesday, June 20th at 2:45 PM, Larry Wikelius, Vice President
for Caviumâ€™s Software Ecosystem and Solutions Group, will host
the Birds of a Feather ([BOF]) Session Designing, Porting & Optimizing
HPC Workloads for ARM Based Systems.  This session will feature
speakers from Oak Ridge National Lab, Sandia National Lab, The
Hartree Center and HPE.

[BOF]:http://www.isc-hpc.com/isc17_ap/sessiondetails.htm?t=session&o=449

The [Going ARM] workshop on 
the morning of Thursday 22 June 2017 features talks on 
ARM tools from Allinea, reports from the Barcelona and Isambard
supercomputer centers, a University of Michigan presentation
from Jonathan Beaumont on ARM's SVE vector processor, and
Giri Chukkapalli of Cavium speaking on the Cavium ThunderX2.

### Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 + Microsoft Windows 10

Microsoft and Qualcomm have announced plans for an ARM based
Windows 10 device to be powered by the Snapdragon 835. The
system was demonstrated running Windows applications in an
emulation mode, and the report from [Tom's Hardware] of that 
demo talks of multiple Office documents, video, and email
running with no visible delays or hiccups.

Demos of the system have been out long out for the tech press
to start to speculate about how this system will fit into
the Windows ecosystem. [Tom's Hardware] has a long and thoughtful
but speculative piece based on reporting of the demos, calling
out the features of this new system and comparing it in
intended function to Google's Chromebook design.

### Minio on Go speedups from FOSDEM

[Minio] is a distributed storage system that provides a familiar
Amazon S3 based programming interface but that runs on your
own systems. The folks at Minio have spent considerable
effort working on performance by embedding Intel and ARM
assembly language routines to take advantage of vector and
matrix operations on both platforms.

Frank Wessels from Minio presented a talk on
[High performance scaling techniques in Golang using Go Assembly], at the
[FOSDEM 17 conference] in Brussels in February 2017. From the talk
preview:

[FOSDEM 17 conference]:https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/go_scaling/

> Regarding hashing we have developed Go packages for two hashing
algorithms (BLAKE2 and SHA256) that take advantage of the Golang
(or Plan9) assembly capabilities. These packages exploit SIMD
instructions of Intel and the Cryptography Extensions for the ARM
platform. The speed up range from 3 to 4 times (Intel) to 100X (on
ARM). Due to the use of Golang assembly there is no need for a
C-compiler in order to use these packages (when compiling from
scratch).

### Wireguard VPN with ARM speedups

[Wireguard] is virtual private network software with a novel
design that puts most of the work into the Linux kernel.
It makes use of familiar Unix networking primitives to
control routing and filtering of packets, allowing the
system manager to compose a VPN out of components that can
each independently be audited for correctness.

[Wireguard]:https://www.wireguard.io

The most recent development snapshot of Wireguard, 0.0.20170531,
includes a set of ARM assembly instructions that speed up
cryptographic operations on ARM NEON capable processors.

Wireguard is in an early pre-production state. It is the
target of the annual Google Summer of Code for 2017, which
should bring about continued development. 
The source is available at https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/ and
information about the project is available at https://www.wireguard.io/ .
