### Go 1.9 Beta 1 with ARM64 binaries

![Go Gopher](https://blog.golang.org/gopher/gopher.png)

[Go 1.9 Beta 1] is the latest test release of the
Go systems programming language. It's an early
unstable release for Go 1.9, which is scheduled to emerge
from beta at the end of July 2017. Consider this release
if you are doing software development and want to 
test compatibility and performance of Go 1.9
on code that you currently have working on an earlier release.

[Go 1.9 Beta 1]:https://golang.org/dl/#unstable

This release is the first from Go to have an ARM64
binary distribution. Go maintainer [Brad Fitzpatrick writes]:
"If we don't hear happy reports, we won't ship it for the final release."

[Brad Fitzpatrick writes]:https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19082#issuecomment-308849384

A final list of new features for Go 1.9 has not emerged yet,
pending resolution of [153 open issues on the project milestone].
If previous beta releases are any guide, you'll want to get your
comments in on this beta over the course of the next week or two
before the next beta comes out.

Go is an important language because of its extensive use at
Google and in cloud-native applications. Docker, Kubernetes,
Minio, CockroachDB, and Prometheus are only a few of the 
packages that depend on Go. It is to be hoped that with Go 1.9
support for ARM64 that each of these systems gets that much
easier in turn to build and maintain on ARM.

Alex Ellis has a short [tutorial on running Go 1.9 beta binaries] on 
a variety of hardware and on hosting providers including 
Packet and Scaleway.

### iPad Pro "fastest yet"

Apple announced a new ARM-powered iPad Pro at the WWDC. 
The device, a 10.5" or 12.9" tablet, is powered
by Apple's own A10X chip. [9to5Mac] and the
[BareFeats weblog] ran benchmarks on graphics and
CPU with the claim that 
and claimed that the new machine compares very
favorably to the 13" Macbook Pro.

[BareFeats weblog]:http://barefeats.com/ipadpro2017.html

From BareFeats, which is written by Rob Art Morgan:

> I am not implying that the iPad Pro can replace the MacBook Pro.
They are two different animals, though there is clearly some overlap
in capability. It's just encouraging to know that the iPad Pro
development has brought it up to laptop level performance.

### Intel, Qualcomm patents

Intel used the [40th anniversary of its x86 design] to
reaffirm its intention to protect its patent rights to
the ISA instruction set used in its computer chips. This
was widely interpreted by the tech press as a challenge
to Qualcomm, whose parternship with Microsoft includes a
just-in-time compiler for x86 capable of running Intel-based
Microsoft Windows user code at full speed. The
[roundup at Techmeme] is a good reference.

[40th anniversary of its x86 design]:https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/x86-approaching-40-still-going-strong/
[roundup at Techmeme]:http://www.techmeme.com/170609/p14#a170609p14

Neither Intel nor Qualcomm are strangers to the patent system,
with both of them measuring out year after year in the top 10
of patents issued. Intel's patents in computing server
technology are every bit as deep as Qualcomm's patents
in mobile technology.  

### MACCHIATObin dev board

![MACCHIATObin photo](https://www.solid-run.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MacchiatoBin-Overview.jpg)

[Marvell has announced] its [MACCHIATObin community development board].
This device, in a convenient mini-ITX form factor, features
a Marvell ARMADA 8040 SoC with four Cortex-A72 ARMv8 processors.
It sports an impressive array of
I/O channels including two 10G Ethernet interfaces,
three SATA 3.0 interfaces, and up to 16G of memory.
This ships at prices starting at $349.
[Solid Run] is the manufacturer.

[CNXSoft has an active discussion] about this board,
including reports from someone who had their device
shipped in May 2017.

Maen Suleiman from Marvell provided the above 
photo and wrote that software support for this device 
includes a 4.4 based kernel and out-of-the-box support
for CentOS 7. The device can boot from PXE and uses UEFI.

### MACCHIATObin cluster

A case and network fabric suitable for building a computing
cluster out of these MACCHIATObin boards was announced at
launch time by [PicoCluster], which also makes cluster cases
for Raspberry Pi. The enclosure, which features space for
six of these compute boards, is sold in a variety of configurations
depending if you need just the case or if you are also buying
the compute boards and network gear.

"Shipping is expected to occur by the end of September 2017 subject
to board and switch availability."

ARM, ENEA, Marvell and PicoCluster all cooperated to produce a
the [NFV Picopod] version of this cluster, complete with a
full software stack that runs the OPNFV Danube software release for ARM.
This software and architecture is designed to be a lab-in-a-box
for developers of network functions virtualization (NFV) code.

### Snapdragon 835 development board from Intrinsyc

[LinuxGizmos.com reports] on a development board from Intrinsyc,
the [Open-Q 835], which features Qualcomm's 8-core Snapdragon 835
SoC. The dev board is in a Mini-ITX form factor and it
provides access to the 835's many functions including
4K HDMI video, dual cameras, GPS, Bluetooth and BLE,
and more.

[LinuxGizmos.com reports]:http://linuxgizmos.com/development-board-unlocks-10nm-snapdragon-835/

[Open-Q 835]:https://www.intrinsyc.com/snapdragon-embedded-development-kits/open-q-835-development-kit/

The device runs Android 7 "Nougat" with a reference to
"contact sales for Windows 10" support. At a pricetag of 
$1,149 for the early adopter version, it is perhaps most
suited to go into the hands of mobile phone engineers who
are looking to incorporate the Snapdragon 835 into their designs.

### ARM at the UEFI Forum

![UEFI logo](http://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/uefi_logo_red_web.jpg)

The [UEFI Forum board appointed Dong Wei], senior director of lead
architect platforms at ARM, as vice president of this industry
group which promotes firmware innovation and standardization.

[UEFI - What is it]? is a presentation given by Dong Wei at the
spring 2017 UEFI Plugfest. It provides a good overview of the
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and the 
Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) that are
used to standardize the boot process across ARM and x86 platforms.
