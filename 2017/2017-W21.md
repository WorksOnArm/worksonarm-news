## Apache Cassandra performance report from Mityltics

I spoke with [Manish Singh] from [MityLytics] on Thursday about his
talk at the Apache Big Data conference. MityLytics ran
a head to head comparison between 
the performance of the [Apache Cassandra] database
on ARM vs Intel
using servers from [Packet] and from Amazon Web Services. The systems
were evaluated based on performance, price, and operations
under a load that reflects the cotenancy common in Cassandra
installations in the real world.

Of the servers compared, Packet's Type 2A 96-core ARM server
compared favorably on many fronts. On the plus side, the many
cores allowed more headroom for more CPU-intensive cotenant loads,
and the fast network allowed it to readily keep up with the test load.
Manish did note that getting Cassandra to run was not a clean
out-of-the-box experience, and that a few changes needed to
be done from the default Apache distribution to get it to work.

The slides for the talk, entitled 
[Cassandra on Armv8 - A comparison with x86 and other platforms], are available from
the Apache Big Data conference web site.
For a [complete report from MityLytics],
contact them for a PDF of conclusions from their benchmarking efforts.

## Go 1.8.3 release

[Go] had two releases this week. 1.8.2 shipped 
on Tuesday May 23, 2017 with a [single bug fix] in the crypto/elliptic library
that affected only the x86 platform. It was followed on the next day, May 24,
with the [Go 1.8.3 release]
which reported fixes to the compiler, runtime,
documentation, and the database/sql package.
See the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.8.3">Go 1.8.3 milestone</a> 
on the issue tracker for details of what was changed.

[Go 1.8.3 release]:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-announce/B5ww0iFt1_Q
[Go]:http://github.com/golang/go

In the release notes for 1.8.3 there are no changes specific to ARM.

We're watching Go closely in anticipation of a Go 1.9 release, which
is expected to have binary support for arm64 as well as a number of
performance improvements specific to ARM. Expect that in the late July
2017 timeframe.

## Erlang, Elixir, and Phoenix

[Erlang] is a functional programming language developed at Ericsson for
telecom and online transaction processing applications. 
It is known for its ability to update complex programs
without bringing the system down, and for its effective
use of multiprocessor systems.
Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for
concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.

[Erlang]:http://erlang.org

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ships with support for Erlang 18
on the ARM platform. Erlang 20 is the latest available
release.

[Elixir] is a language written to
use Erlang's BEAM runtime, and 
[Phoenix] uses that language to deploy a speedy,
productive web framework.

## HHVM: a virtual machine for running PHP and Hack

[HHVM] is a virtual machine and just-in-time compiler (JIT) for
applications written in PHP and Hack. Developed by Facebook, it
is a response to PHP performance issues at scale, and it has
been responsible for 10x speedups on applications. The
[HHVM on ARM mailing list] is for developers working on the language
and its implementation.

The March 2017 essay 
[How the Cyber-Elephant got its ARM]
by Max Wang gives a lot of detail
in how HHVM was ported to ARM. HHVM had originally targeted
Intel systems only, and the team rearchitected the just-in-time
compiler to emit a stream of symbols that could be easily
handled by not only an x86 back end but also ARM and Power systems.

## GNU Parallel

[GNU Parallel] is designed to support parallel computation
on multicore machines via the Unix command line. As a drop-in
replacement for `xargs`, it makes it easy to execute a series
of commands each on their own processor from a pipeline.

If your task responds to "embarrassingly easy" parallelism,
GNU Parallel is a very straightforward way to keep a lot of
cores running. This is a good addition to your toolkit on a
system like the 96-core Packet Type 2A system where you 
might easily improve simple parallel tasks manyfold.

The [GNU Parallel paper] describing its motivation and operations
is O. Tange (2011): GNU Parallel - The Command-Line Power Tool, 
;login: The USENIX Magazine, February 2011:42-47.

## FFmpeg

[FFmpeg] is a video processing command-line program and set of libraries.
It handles a variety of video and audio formats, and has been
developed since the year 2000 in fast C and assembly code, including
ARM64 assembly for performance. FFmpeg is 
capable of applications such as transcoding from one video file
format to another, extracting an audio track from a video file, 
adding subtitles to video, and many more video and 
audio transformations
limited only by your imagination and ability to construct a command line
suitable for expressing your task.

[FFmpeg]:http://ffmpeg.org/

ffmpeg version 2.8.11-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 is provided on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
for ARM. The latest development release is 3.3.1, provided online
through multiple git repositories including the
[FFmpeg repository on Github].

## Firefly's ARMv8 Kickstarter project

The [Firefly-RK3399] is a six-core ARMv8 single-board computer that
was funded by a Kickstarter campaign that launched in December 2016.  
The project raised over $60,000 from more than 200 backers,
and is now available from [Firefly] for a list price of $199.00.

Featuring a Rockchip RK3399 SoC chipset at its core, the
Firefly-RK3399 advertises compatibility with Ubuntu 16.04 and
Android.  The six-core system has two Cortex-A72 high-performance
cores and four Cortex-A53 cores.  Hardware on board includes a ARM
Mali-T864 GPU, with the system advertised as suitable for computer
vision, machine learning, and 4K 3D rendering.
