### Traefik 1.5 release

Træfɪk (traefik) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer
made to deploy microservices with ease. It supports several backends
(Docker, Swarm, Mesos/Marathon, Consul, Etcd, Zookeeper, BoltDB,
Rest API, file...) to manage its configuration automatically and
dynamically.

Træfik can listen to your service registry/orchestrator API, and
knows each time a microservice is added, removed, killed or upgraded,
and can generate its configuration automatically. Routes to your
services will be created instantly.

Version 1.5 of Traefik was released on January 24, 2018. It includes
support for changes at Let's Encrypt, as well as new support for
dynamic TLS configurations and rate limiting. Traefik provides
arm64 binaries as well as a multi-architecture container image.
