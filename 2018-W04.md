### Julia, a scientific programming language

Julia is a high-level programming language for numerical and
scientific computing. Julia provides the ease of use of Python and
R, with the performance of C. It provides a sophisticated compiler,
distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive
mathematical function library. Julia's package manager currently
includes over 1,600 community package contributions, in addition
to being able to call libaries from Python, R, C, and Fortran.
Julia is also well integrated into the Jupyter notebook UI, which
is widely used for teaching.

Julia uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure to generate optimized
native code on Arm. The current version of Julia is v0.6.2 of
December 13, 2017, with binaries available for 32-bit and 64-bit
Arm. A 0.7 development version is also available.

### guix, the GNU package manager

guix is the GNU package manager.  In addition to standard package
management features, Guix supports transactional upgrades and
roll-backs, unprivileged package management, per-user profiles, and
garbage collection. Guix uses low-level mechanisms from the Nix
package manager, except that packages are defined as native Guile
modules, using extensions to the Scheme language. GuixSD offers a
declarative approach to operating system configuration management,
and is highly customizable and hackable.

guix is now building aarch64 (arm64) binaries, after a donation of
a Softiron 1000 build system from Richard Henwood at Arm Holdings.
They write:

> Until now though, the project’s official build farms were not
building aarch64 binaries. Consequently, Guix on aarch64 would build
everything from source. We are glad that this is about to be fixed.
We will need to expand our build capacity for this architecture and
for ARMv7 as well, and you too can help!

### Linuxkit 0.2 release

### Traefik 1.5 release

Træfɪk (traefik) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer
made to deploy microservices with ease. It supports several backends
(Docker, Swarm, Mesos/Marathon, Consul, Etcd, Zookeeper, BoltDB,
Rest API, file...) to manage its configuration automatically and
dynamically.

Træfik can listen to your service registry/orchestrator API, and
knows each time a microservice is added, removed, killed or upgraded,
and can generate its configuration automatically. Routes to your
services will be created instantly.

Version 1.5 of Traefik was released on January 24, 2018. It includes
support for changes at Let's Encrypt, as well as new support for
dynamic TLS configurations and rate limiting. Traefik provides
arm64 binaries as well as a multi-architecture container image.
