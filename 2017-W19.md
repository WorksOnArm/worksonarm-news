# Works on ARM news, Issue 3, Friday May 12, 2017 (Week 19)

This is the third edition of Works on ARM news, a newsletter
from [Ed Vielmetti], Special Projects Director at Packet that covers development of
software for ARMv8 in open source and the enterprise.

[Ed Vielmetti]:https://www.packet.net/about/ed-vielmetti/

This issue has Resin's 144-node ARM-based "Beast" cluster, a
conference report from Red Hat Summit in Boston, video from
DockerCon in Austin, an OpenBSD 6.1 release, and software
from NGINX and Portainer.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for Issue 4, please 
send them to ed@packet.net or contact me on the Packet community Slack
channel as "ed.packet". Tweets can be send to the @[worksonarm] account
or to @[vielmetti].

## Golang 1.9 plan for ARM64 support

The Go language team (golang) has moved [ARM64 binary support for Go] onto
their [Go 1.9 release target schedule], due out at the end of July 2017.
Up until now, to bootstrap Go from source, it had been necessary to
cross-compile the compiler or build from a previously cross-complied 
version. The release target will allow downstream projects such
as Docker and Kubernetes to build directly from a supported version of Go.

[Go 1.9 release target schedule]:https://github.com/golang/go/milestone/49
[ARM64 binary support for Go]:https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19082

## Build notes: Resin's "Beast"

The folks at [resin.io] have built several versions of a Raspberry
Pi ARM-powered cluster for demonstrating their fleet management
capabilities. This [144-node cluster] features a field of displays
which are driven directly by each Pi. The housing hides a modular
network of switches and wires used to connect the Pi network together.
Having finished Beast v2, the team is hard at work on a third
generation of the effort.

## Conference reports: Red Hat Summit

Red Hat Summit in Boston was on May 2-4, 2017 featured the ARM Pavillion.
Vendors [Cavium], [Qualcomm], [Packet], [Linaro], [Phoenics Electronics] and [Gigabyte]
were in attendance alongside ARM. I was on the show floor for three days,
talking to people from a variety of industries and from [Red Hat].

[Phoenics Electronics]:https://www.phoenicselectronics.com/
[Gigabyte]:http://www.gigabyte.us/
[Red Hat]:http://redhat.com

[Jon Masters], Chief ARM Architect at Red Hat, led a panel session on "ARM Servers
in the Datacenter", and [Jeffrey Burt] of [Next Platform] summarized the session
by saying that [Red Hat is the Gatekeeper for ARM in the Datacenter].

[Red Hat is the Gatekeeper for ARM in the Datacenter]:https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/05/05/red-hat-gatekeeper-arm-datacenter/

> If any new hardware technology is going to get traction in the
datacenter, it has to have the software behind it. And as the
dominant supplier of commercial Linux, Red Hat’s support of ARM-based
servers gives the upstart chip makers like Applied Micro, Cavium,
and Qualcomm the leverage to help pry the glasshouse doors open and
get a slice of the server and storage business that is so utterly
dominated by Intel’s Xeon processors today.

Some comments from panelists captured by Next Platform:

[Jeff Underhill], director of open source enablement at ARM: 

> Any idea that ARM in the datacenter is a myth is a misconception....
It's a marathon, not a sprint, and we're well on our way.

[Zachary Smith], Packet founder and CEO:

> It’s all about new workloads. I don’t care if it’s X86 or ARM. A
few years from now, 90 percent of workloads will be new.

## Conference reports: OpenStack Boston

This week was OpenStack Boston - awaiting word from reports from the
show floor.

## Conference videos: DockerCon

All of the [breakout session video recordings from DockerCon 2017] are
now available for viewing. Of especial interest are the talks
by Justin Cormack on [LinuxKit], Julius Volz on
[Prometheus], and Christy Perez and Chris Jones from IBM
on [From ARM to Z: building, shipping, and running a multi-platform Docker swarm].

## Upcoming events

Mityltics will be at Apache Big Data 2017, May 16-18 in Miami, 
with Manish Singh presenting on 
[Cassandra on ARMv8 - A Comparison with x86 and Other Processor Platforms](https://apachebigdata2017.sched.com/event/9zsr/cassandra-on-armv8-a-comparison-with-x86-and-other-processor-platforms-manish-singh-mitylytics).

[Apache Big Data 2017]:https://apachebigdata2017.sched.com

The [call for proposals deadline for ARM TechCon](http://www.armtechcon.com/arm-techcon-2017-call-for-proposals-now-open/) is May 19,
for an event to be held October 24-26 in Santa Clara, CA.

## OpenBSD 6.1 release

[OpenBSD 6.1] was released, with [new support for the arm64 platform], 
on April 11, 2017. The current target platforms are the Firefly-RK3399,
the Pine64, Raspberry Pi 3 and Opteron A1100 (Seattle). On the Pi 3,
there is no driver yet for the SD coard, so a USB drive and manual
steps are needed for a boot. "Please be aware that OpenBSD support 
for this platform is far from complete." [Detailed instructions for OpenBSD]
describe the entire process from start to finish.

## Portainer – a management interface for Docker

[Portainer] is a simple management solution for Docker which allows
you to easily manage your Docker host or Swarm cluster. It provides
a detailed overview of Docker and allows you to manage containers,
images, networks and volumes.

[Portainer]:http://portainer.io

Portainer can be built from source or launched from 
[a provided Docker container]. The container provided has multiple 
architecture (multiarch) support and will 
launch a correct version for ARMv8 as well as
running on Raspberry Pi, Intel Linux, Windows, and Power architectures.

[a provided Docker container]:https://hub.docker.com/r/portainer/portainer/

Multiarch support in Portainer is enabled by the use
of the Go language (which supports straightforward
cross-compilation) as well as by the use of 
[manifest-tool] from Phil Estes of IBM. This tool
updates the package manifest in the Docker registry to
point correctly to the right architecture for each of
the supported systems that a multiarch container handles.

## Web infrastructure

[Nginx] is a web server, reverse proxy server, load balancer and
HTTP cache. Since 2014 it has been commercially supported on ARMv8.

[Nginx]:http://www.nginx.com

[TIRIAS Research] has released a report on [NGINX CDN using ThunderX],
analyzing a comparison of total cost of ownership and performance
for an Intel Xeon system compared to Cavium's ThunderX.  The ARM
system compares favorably to the Intel system on performance coming
in at a favorable price point. Registration is required to get the
free rerport.

## Continuous integration

Several open source projects at Packet are using Jenkins
for continuous integration and remote builds. If your project
currently builds on ARM - or if you'd like it to - contact
ed@packet.net to discuss your build needs.
