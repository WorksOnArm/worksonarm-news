### Project Trillium - Arm machine learning

EE Times, Tirias Research: "Arm claims its cores will sport 3
TOPs/Watt, more than 4.6 TOPs in total (8-bit integer) performance
and up to a 4x increases in performance with further optimizations.
Initially, Project Trillium cores have a target power consumption
of 1.5W on a 7nm fabrication process. The new cores can be integrated
with existing Arm cores in a unified memory architecture that
leverages open source software."
