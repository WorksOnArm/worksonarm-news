### Project Trillium - Arm machine learning

Arm: "Project Trillium represents a suite of Arm products that gives
device-makers all the hardware and software choices they need. It
also enables a seamless link into a bank of Arm partners delivering
neural network (NN) apps including leading frameworks such as Google
TensorFlow, Caffe, Android NN API and MXNet."

EE Times, Tirias Research: "Arm claims its cores will sport 3
TOPs/Watt, more than 4.6 TOPs in total (8-bit integer) performance
and up to a 4x increases in performance with further optimizations.
Initially, Project Trillium cores have a target power consumption
of 1.5W on a 7nm fabrication process. The new cores can be integrated
with existing Arm cores in a unified memory architecture that
leverages open source software."

### Resin.IO case study and plans

Packet has published a case study of Resin.IO moving from QEMU emulation to
native builds on Arm hardware, with a speedup of up to 5x.

> The other big plan for this year is to launch their own Arm-based
hardware: a carrier board based on the Raspberry Pi compute module
3 that was released last year. “We’re building in a lot of features
that our customers find missing from stock Raspberry Pi’s when they
scale up from prototype to production,” says Alison Davis, the
company’s director of product marketing and strategy.  The carrier
board will have onboard storage and industrial connectors and power.

### Making sense of /proc/cpuinfo on Arm

The `/proc/cpuinfo` file in on a Linux system shows details of the
CPU you are running on. On Arm systems it has rather less detail than
on other legacy processors. Riku Voipio of Linaro writes about the
difficulties in getting the wide range of details around new Arm
processors into the Linux kernel, and solves the problem of identifying
your Arm system with enhancements to `lscpu`.
