### Project Trillium - Arm machine learning

Arm: "Project Trillium represents a suite of Arm products that gives
device-makers all the hardware and software choices they need. It
also enables a seamless link into a bank of Arm partners delivering
neural network (NN) apps including leading frameworks such as Google
TensorFlow, Caffe, Android NN API and MXNet."

EE Times, Tirias Research: "Arm claims its cores will sport 3
TOPs/Watt, more than 4.6 TOPs in total (8-bit integer) performance
and up to a 4x increases in performance with further optimizations.
Initially, Project Trillium cores have a target power consumption
of 1.5W on a 7nm fabrication process. The new cores can be integrated
with existing Arm cores in a unified memory architecture that
leverages open source software."

### Resin.IO case study and plans

Packet has published a case study of Resin.IO moving from QEMU emulation to
native builds on Arm hardware, with a speedup of up to 5x.

> The other big plan for this year is to launch their own Arm-based
hardware: a carrier board based on the Raspberry Pi compute module
3 that was released last year. “We’re building in a lot of features
that our customers find missing from stock Raspberry Pi’s when they
scale up from prototype to production,” says Alison Davis, the
company’s director of product marketing and strategy.  The carrier
board will have onboard storage and industrial connectors and power.

### Making sense of /proc/cpuinfo on Arm

The `/proc/cpuinfo` file in on a Linux system shows details of the
CPU you are running on. On Arm systems it has rather less detail than
on other legacy processors. Riku Voipio of Linaro writes about the
difficulties in getting the wide range of details around new Arm
processors into the Linux kernel, and solves the problem of identifying
your Arm system with enhancements to `lscpu`.

Similar projects for identifying processor capabilities are `hwloc` from
the OpenMPI community, and Google's C++ library `cpu_features`.

### Booting ARM64 builds of Windows 10 in QEMU

It's "slow as dirt", but engineer Rafael Rivera has the new arm64 Windows 10 
booting on a legacy processor with QEMU. It involves running
hand-crafted UEFI firmware and recompiled/signed arm64 storage drivers,
and it includes a whimsical boot logo to discourage serious usage.

### Creating Docker multiarch images (Richard Gee)

Richard Gee walks the reader through building Docker multi-arch images,
using the new `docker manifest` tool available in Docker 18.02-ce and
later.

> Why? Quite simply, it removes complexity. In the pre-multi-arch
world it would typically be the case that multiple Docker hub repo's
would need to be visited, namespaces determined, or tags forensically
interrogated in order to create bespoke Dockerfiles for each platform
being targeted by the application.

### CNCF "serverless landscape" and working group

CNCF created the Serverless Working Group to "explore the intersection
of cloud native and serverless technology." The first output of the
group was creation of serverless landscape, which is available here.
The whitepaper is the second contribution of the Serverless Working
Group. The whitepaper goes beyond merely answering the questions
facing the serverless community; it defines serverless computing:

> Serverless computing refers to the concept of building and running
applications that do not require server management. It describes a
finer-grained deployment model where applications, bundled as one
or more functions, are uploaded to a platform and then executed,
scaled, and billed in response to the exact demand needed at the
moment.

### First impressions of Rockchip RK3399 powered Odroid N1 (Armbian)

"Not a review yet" but lots of pictures.

> What we already know is that the SoC is one of Rockchip's 'open
source SoCs' so software support is already pretty good and the
chip vendor itself actively upstreams software support. We also
know RK3399 is not the greatest choice for compiling code...
We also know that this SoC has 2 USB3 ports and implements PCIe 2.1
with a four lane interface. But so far we don't know how the internal
bottlenecks look like so let's focus on this now.

### Fedora Council Subproject Report: Internet of Things

Peter Robinson from Fedora is guest on the Fedora Council
subproject meeting, available in recorded form via Youtube,
discussing running Fedora on "Internet of Things" devices.
It's a thoughtful account of what it takes to bring an existing
operating system to an ecosystem.
